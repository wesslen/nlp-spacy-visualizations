# NLP/spaCy visualization tools

This is the slim version that is available for binder.

Note: this version does not include `bulk` so you will not be able to run that part of this code. If you're interested, look at the main branch of this repo.

## ‚è© Getting started

It is recommended to create a new virtual environment before starting. I only installed this with Python 3.9 so it may not work for different Python versions.

```bash
python3.9 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
```

When you have a fresh environment, run the following commands from the root repo directory:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## To start Jupyter

To start Jupyter, run:

```bash
jupyter-lab
```
