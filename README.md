# NLP/spaCy visualization tools

You can view (read-only) the notebook [here](https://github.com/wesslen/nlp-spacy-visualizations/blob/main/01-spacy-visualizer.ipynb).

## ‚è© Getting started: running the notebook

It is recommended to create a new virtual environment before starting. I only installed this with Python 3.9 so it may not work for different Python versions.

```bash
python3.9 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
```

When you have a fresh environment, run the following commands from the root repo directory:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## To start Jupyter

To start Jupyter, run:

```bash
jupyter-lab
```
