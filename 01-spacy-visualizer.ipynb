    "[spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is a free, open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python. It’s designed specifically for production use and helps you build applications that process and “understand” large volumes of text. It can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems. spaCy is created by [Explosion](https://explosion.ai/). Explosion also makes [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), which is a scriptable annotation tool for creating training and evaluation data for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial won't have enough time to go through everything about spaCy -- instead, I'll show you a few examples and also provide some helpful visualizer tools that are part of spaCy's universe. Along the way, I'll introduce you to several of Python's most popular visualization tools like Matplotlib, plotly, Altair, and bokeh.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in learning more about spaCy, I recommend spaCy's [free online course](https://course.spacy.io/en) as well as its [spaCy 101 documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101). If you're also interested in learning more about Python, I highly recommend [calmcode.io](), which has a ton of free/helpful videos on many Python and related tools.\n",

You would think that this means you can find what you want, and generally you can, but it also means enormous crowds, no matter when you shop here.\\n\\nYou know that a trip to a large, \\\"one size fits all\\\" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at Macy's or Boscov's.  You know that it's pretty hard to give a place like this five stars.  Its purpose is purely utilitarian.  But good gravy, you'd think that a place like this could handle large crowds.  It shouldn't take you a half-hour just to get one item.  \\n\\nThat's what happened to me yesterday.  I would have been better off going to Cogo's or 7-11.  I might have paid a bit more, but I would have been in-and-out in under five minutes.  I prefer the Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill.",

All of the other use spring mix to make their fuji chicken salad except this one.. They just use regular salad and salad doesn't taste or look very fresh either. I was kind of excited to find there is a panera bread around us but I am disappointed after trying it. Don't know if we will be back again.",
          "Best pierogies in tahn!  \\n\\nI usually just go with the standard potato and cheese but I've also tried a few of the other pierogies and some of the plus.  These pierogies can't be beat.  Made by hand with love in the traditional old world style, I have yet to find better.\\n\\nIt's amazing to get there at 10:55am, 5 minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies.  By 11am, the line is already out the door.  Always a good sign.  They serve their pierogies hot, cold or frozen.  I always go with the hot because nothing beats pierogies bathing in butter and onions.  And here at Pierogies Plus, they are definitely worth the wait.",

When I told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said \\\"oh that's ok....\\\" And hung up on me. I will never be ordering from them again, which is a shame since they are so close to me. I immediately called Pizza Parma which gladly delivered to me. I recommend ordering from Pizza Parma since they have similar menu items, they post accurate hours, and they don't hang up on you! Seriously? Why answer the phone?",
          "I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\\n\\nThe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good.",

          "I will start by saying this review is for the hot bar and I must of gone at an off hour for the hot bar and by that I mean during the dinner rush before they replenished it. I would say everything I got from the salad bar to the hot bar was good apart from they had run out of soup/special of the day and the chicken was beyond dry, the time I spent in the dessert was a wet oasis compared to the chicken. I just feel that for the price I paid it was not worth it. I have been to a smaller whole foods with a better hot bar and to the one in New York City and remember it being great. I only give this one 3 stars because the Mac n cheese and vegan tofu loaf was rather good. But I must repeat myself about the price. For what I got it's way to much. It's hard to justify paying that much when I could make it for 1/5th the price at home. Now I know I don't have to cook or clean and that's the point of eating out but I could also go to trader joes get a few frozen meals and eat for over a day for the price of one hot bar meal from whole foods.",
          "So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\\n\\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\\n\\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \\n\\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\\n\\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. \\n\\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)",
          "Little slow on the service and didn't have the beer I wanted on the menu. But you get those things when they brew their own beers on-site.   But the stadium pretzels are good.  The cream stout is tasty.\\n\\nThe burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries.  I'm not a fan of the skinny fry, but hey the burgers would choke a horse - and almost did.  :o)",
          "Meh. I've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!\\n\\nTheir steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.\\n\\nThe seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain \\\"I taste like iodine\\\" flavor.\\n\\nThe advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive).",
          "Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.",

          "On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  \\n\\nInside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \\n\\nOne random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \\n\\nNot only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.",

The Car and Carriage Museum is very well worth going to. And the amazing part is that is free. \\n\\nThe Frick Art Museum is not really that interesting or great. There is hardly anything of note. As far as I can see, Helen Frick had way more money than taste and money can't buy you taste. When J.P. Morgan died, he donated his entire art collection to the Met in New York. However the Met did not want everything. Helen Frick bought many pieces that the Met had already passed on, with good reason. Of course not all of the Frick Art collection consists of the Met's castoffs. There many portraits of insignificant nobility done by French court painters who had little talent. Just bec. art is old or expensive, doesn't mean it's really any good. It's a good thing this museum is free.",

I felt sick before I got halfway through it. That reminds me - the slices are HUGE, and are $2. The onion rings were extremely basic - I gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.\\nOne irritating thing I overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like \\\"we don't have those anymore\\\" or \\\"no, we can't cook wings dry.\\\" Sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated.",

Another thing I miss is creamed spinach... I have yet to see this dish on a Pittsburgh buffet but if you go outside of the city it is a staple among Chines buffets.\\n\\nAnother star got knocked off for the lack of fresh fruit on the dessert table.

They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.

The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.\\n- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.\\n- Amusing name.\\n\\nBAD:\\n- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\\n- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.\\n- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.\\n\\nCome if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low.",
          "I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \\n\\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\\n\\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \\n\\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \\\"mistake\\\" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\\n\\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.",
          "Great little gem! The food was fantastic was very food and just the right price. The Italian food was amazing, but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving. I had the carrot cake yummy!! Def a place everyone should try.",

She never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors. \\n\\nThe burger was really greasy, the fries were Luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed.",

Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.  My only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy, and I spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  Not sure I would make the hour+ trip to Pittsburgh again, but if I found myself in the city, I may just stop by.",
          "Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. The server was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Maybe they were short handed.  The food was to me not even average. I ordered a burger, which very overdone and dry. Had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalape\\u00f1o slice on each piece. Imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  Not like any nachos I've ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them.",

Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. \\n\\nThe service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.  \\n\\nI think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation.",

My MOH and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!\\n\\nAlso, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun!",
          "My husbands first time.  Nice to be able to pick your fish and style of cooking.  I had a trio of Jamaican jerk tilapia,  salmon,  and scallops.  All good but too much sauce on scallops.  Husband had surf n turf special. Snow crab legs tasty but smaller portion than I expected. Glad they had raw oysters,  but no idea where they were from.  For $2.50 each you'd think they'd say.  Waitstaff friendly but inexperienced when it came to wine.  We taught two of them how to open a champagne bottle.  Nice time out,  but two gripes... #1 Used my phones flashlight to see if there was an outlet on the floor.  Felt like an archaeologist finding old remains of dinners gone by.  Crumbs,  napkins wedged between booth and wall,  gum,  dirt.  For the price I would expect a cleaner place. #2 our waiter kept saying Thank you. After every single sentence,  even when it wasn't appropriate.  Silly gripe,  right?  But it was way over the top and felt more like,  Can I have a tip?  Can I have a tip?",

Very reasonably priced for shows  though they have the two item minimum so would suggest they all be drinks.\\n\\nThe food leaves little to be desired. We decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at 7. Having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken. Spinach and artichoke dip was good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chips. Sauteed grilled chicken - hmmm.... I think the chicken was frozen - definitely not fresh - and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese. It looked like a mess with big ole pile of fries. A lot of food for $10. Service has always been pleasant though they do automatically tack on the tip for you at 18%.",
          "Sadly I've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \\\"alright\\\" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\\n\\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\\n\\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\\n\\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.",
          "Rather typical SnS.  Had a good lunch crowd.  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street.  It took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS.  Ordered the Guacamole Steakburger and it only had a small portion of Gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.  Definitely did not look like the picture on the website.  Oh well!",

I had the cheese steak and my husband had a peanut tofu wrap, both were served with chips.  Everything was great.  If I had any complaint it would be that I didn't see on the menu that my cheese steak had mayo on it.  I'm not a big fan of it, so had I see that I would have asked for it without.  Other then that great place!",
          "There's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  Our orders were somewhat mixed up.  The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  The crust was delicious and homemade.  If you are going to order something, I would go with the pizza.  We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  If you are looking for good food, Homestead better choices at Blue Dust or Tin Front.",
          "OMG good pierogis in a classic blue collar 'hood. At first glance, it looks like a place to get a flat fixed on your tire.

It's well worth the mapquest ...",

          "I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. \\n\\nBaked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. \\nLazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. \\nPanna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.\\n\\nMy friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? \\nWe tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.\\n\\nI don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there.",

          "Best coffee it Pittsburgh? Maybe, but this place is certainly competitive. French Press, Drip, espresso, or pour over? You name it they've got it. Only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. If it is just coffee you want you this is the place. It is it a bit snobbish sure, but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in Pittsburgh.",
          "I'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this TGI Fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the \\\"chain\\\" expectation. \\n\\nI order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird.\\n\\nFortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly. \\n\\nI'd recommend the TGI Fridays out in South Hills Village over this one any day.",
          "Although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! Outrageous !\\nThere is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. I will most likely not return. Very overpriced for the quality and service.",

I won't becoming back anytime soon.",
          "Overall a good experience. Food was mostly very good. My sweet pea risotto was just OK. My wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. Neither of us are big eaters, but noted how small the portions were, especially compared to the price. One cup of risotto for $20+? Four ravioli for the same?\\n\\nThey altered the desert recipe on request, which for sure was over and above the call.\\n\\nService was attentive and the setting nice.",

          "I had always meant to visit Enrico's, and since my friend recently moved to the neighborhood, it was a perfect opportunity to cross it off my list.\\n\\nSo here's what I liked: the cappuccino was perfect. It's an awesome cappuccino, topped with a cute foam art leaf.\\n\\nHere's what I didn't like: Sometimes I take my cappuccino plain, sometimes I take it with a shot of syrup. On this occassion I asked if I could get amaretto syrup, which they had. But the barista responded: \\\"No, you can't.\\\" He said they only make their cappuccino plain, and if I liked sweet, he could make me something special, but I would have to trust his taste. Here's the thing...I don't like sweet! I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. I just got it plain.\\n\\nI'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a Starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a \\\"REAL\\\" cappuccino tasted like. Please, I lived in Italy, I've had a \\\"REAL\\\" cappuccino...but right now, I want a flavor shot in it. I still tipped because I wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place, and he did offer to make me something different. I just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not \\\"allowed\\\" to add them to your drink? \\n\\nIt's a 5-star cappuccino for sure, but I had to subtract a star for the attitude.",

          "My husband and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town, we made reservations here because word on the street was that it was good. Verdict? It was so-so. We had reservations at 7:15 and were seated promptly, which was fine, except we were seated OUTSIDE! Listen folks, it's COLD when the sun goes down. They have three tables set outside, I guess trying to squeeze out some more business. Our server was nice, but not attentive at all.  We were left waiting for things for 10-20 minutes at a time. Also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. It took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. Wine was good. Food was ehhhhhh. We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all.  The best part of the night? Leaving. The worst part of the night? Associating this place with my anniversary.",
          "This thrift store is one of the best in Pittsburgh; it's huge and has a great selection of books, clothes and housewares.\\n\\nWith that being said, there are a number of drawbacks to shopping here because of its popularity. It starts with the parking. There are a few spots in front of the store, with two \\\"overflow\\\" lots that quickly fill up. Getting out is a bear if you're heading back towards the city, like I usually am, because to pull up to the traffic light you have to go the wrong way through the very narrow parking area in front of the store. Crossing three lanes on 51 without the help of a traffic light just seems like a bad plan.\\n\\nOnce inside the store, beware of other customers on the weekends. I've encountered aggressive shoppers on multiple occasions who are usually welding carts as weapons. Let's just say some shoppers think it's OK to block off entire aisles so they can peruse a section.\\n\\nOther notes: There are no fitting rooms. I sometimes try on clothes over the ones I'm wearing in front of a mirror, because hey, it's a thrift store.\\n\\nAlso, they're cash only.\\n\\nDespite these setbacks, I find myself coming back every few months because I've found some really awesome things here, from dresses to plates.

I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. I am not into fishing or hunting live prey so I am not sure about these departments? I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products.",

Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie\\n\\nI can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.\\n\\nNow here comes the bad:\\n\\n1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE.

          "So when we first went here for brunch, I had no idea it was a vegetarian restaurant.  That's an unpleasant prospect to face down after a hard night of drinking, which is the only time the idea of brunch ever occurs to me.  But then, the grim Spectre of Laziness appeared to me and asked, \\\"Do you really want to drive to another place?  Just look at you. Your wearing the same shirt that you wore yesterday dude.\\\"  \\n\\nThe Spectre of Laziness is a dick, but he was also right.  And to my surprise, nothing I had was bad at all.  For brunch options, meat eaters will find that potatoes and eggs are the cornerstone of any breakfast, and seitan substitutions are not as bad as say, having the grim Spectre of Laziness point out your slovenly appearance.  \\n\\nI think the biggest surprise in this place is that, though nothing is particularly jarring to the palate, there is nothing that really stands out as being amazing.  In Yelp terms: it's kind of a 3.  For hard core vegetarians having a night, er, mid-afternoon on the town, it's probably a blessed change from the meat based culture that Pittsburgh is pretty famous for.  But I'm willing to wager that very meat eaters will become converted to vegetarians after this.  Maybe they did TOO good of a job substituting meat items.  That being said, we did make it back another time for lunch where I had a vegetarian gyro.  My friend said it best: \\\"What's the fucking point?\\\"\\n\\nThe service is always very sweet, but both times the waiters have been curiously, nay ominously spacey.  Even when it wasn't crowded there had to be some substantial flag downs and polite and doleful eye contact before they would do what you needed.  If you're in the area and looking for...this type of thing, you really don't have too many other options so just eat it.",

Children's clothing, toys, electronics and health & beauty items have been moved to other parts of the store. There is a new Starbucks that is now open. The cafe that is there has been remodeled and will serve Pizza Hut pizza and other new menu items. The area where the electronics used to be it is now going to have a small grocery section.

          "This is a cozy little place. I made last minute reservations for a Saturday evening because the restaurant we were supposed to go to  closed due to an emergency. Major bummer for us, but life goes on and luckily we were able to get a table at this place. At first we were seated by the register area and that was a little awkward because it felt like the hostess and waitresses were right at the table with us. I wasn't in the mood for a large group dinner so we asked to be moved, a request they graciously accomodated. Unfortunately, we were then seated pretty close to the door and it was a cold February evening so that was a little rough. Fortunately, we had a whole bottle of wine to warm us up.\\n\\nOK, so now let's talk about the wine thing: \\nthis is the first BYOB place I've ever eaten at and I loved it! It's pretty great to share a bottle of wine that you can pick out yourself, rather than spend a fortune on some ordinary bottle offered by the restaurant. I didn't know if we had to open the bottle ourselves and brought a cork screw just in case, but turns out they open it for you; I can't remember if there was a corkage fee, but it they do it's a small fee.\\n\\nNow, for the food: we shared a sardine appetizer and it was quite good. The bread was also really delicious, very fresh and soft. For my entree I ordered the lobster tail and that was very tasty! The veggies served alongside were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light and flavorful. We ended the meal with a chocolate mousse, which my partner didn't love, but I thought it was pretty good, definitely not the best I've had, but good!\\n\\nTo sum it all up: good food, cozy place, and friendly staff!",

Keep up the good work, Climbing Wall. I'll be seeing you a lot for the next year :)",

My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.\\n\\nMy pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.\\n\\nWell, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. \\n\\nThe first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. \\n\\nCan I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.\\n\\nI know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)",

A friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there EVER!  You can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part.

          "I was determined to let this one pass (experience was not worth commentary) until I made a disturbing discovery...\\n\\nI made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, \\\"the host is supposed to do that but I will...\\\" Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. \\n\\nI was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. \\n\\nCasbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.\\n\\n**Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!",
          "I love hardware stores.  LOVE.  But this Home Depot has disappointed me.  The location is great, but the floor staff is unhelpful.\\n\\nTonight was a great example of I don't like the floor staff.  My vacuum stopped picking up anything but the largest pieces of dust.  After opening her up, I quickly realized I needed a new belt.  It was pouring down rain, but I put on my rainboots, grabbed an umbrella, and hoofed it over to ye ole Home Depot.  I had to stand over the shoulders of five--yep, I counted five--employees in appliances for a full minute before one of them would help me.\\n\\nAfter someone directed me to the vacuum parts, I had two male employees stop by to see if I needed help as I searched for the correct belt.  I had the vacuum's name and number written down, as well as the belt style, and had the actual busted belt with me.  Yet, each of these men acted like I was some stupid girl.  \\\"Did you unplug the vacuum before you removed the old belt?\\\" one asked me.  Duh.  I'm not an idiot.  The other later asked, \\\"Do you always wear bright yellow rainboots when you're doing repairs?\\\" and snickered.  Look, all I said to both gentlemen was \\\"I'm just looking for the correct style number.  But thanks.\\\"\\n\\nI received similar treatment I stopped by to buy a new set of bits for my drill.  \\\"You know drills come in more than one kind, right?\\\" I was asked.  And when I needed a new bag of dirt of my cacti, I was question about why I wanted succulent dirt over potting soil.  Every time a male employee here approaches me, I'm questioned or given unsolicited advice in a snotty way.\\n\\nThis girl may wear bright yellow rainboots, but I am also the Norm Abram of my family.  AKA I'm pretty handy.  Oh, and the vacuum works perfectly now.\\n\\nShout out goes to the check out attendants, who were SUPER polite.  Nice work, ladies.",
          "The order process went well and the delivery arrived in a timely manner. I saw a picture of the flowers my friend received and the arrangement  wasn't even close to what was pictured on the website...a lot more filler flowers despite ordering the premium arrangement. I picked this place specifically because of what they offered despite other cheaper places in the area. I am disappointed because I wanted the best arrangement possible for my friend who is going through a tough time. \\n\\nI will not order from this place again.",
          "Visiting from NY, we actually found this highly-rated restaurant on Yelp ... and we were certainly not disappointed! It's situated on a nice residential block near a large liquor store (byob).  The ambiance is fantastic and the staff are warm, friendly and attentive. We were seated in the private back room because no other tables were available. A real VIP treatment.  \\nFor starters, the goat cheese pastry and smoked salmon appetizers were to die for. Many of the others sounded great too.  Our daughter, who is at college here, was missing some of the food options of NY. Not any more. She had the lamb burger with feta cheese. I had the seafood stew and my wife had Chilean sea bass.  All fantastic! Thankfully we had just enough room for tres leches dessert. If anyone knows of a Portuguese restaurant this good in NYC ... or even in Newark Ironbound I'd love to hear about it.  We will definitely be back!",
          "Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  But, that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again.",
          "The food was really good, but the prices were pretty high and the portions were on the small side. The desserts were the high point of the meal for me. I got the \\\"shark fin\\\" pie and it was really good. The waitress thought I wouldn't be able to finish it... but I showed her. Take that, waitress.",
          "The experience was not that great. The lady taking the orders was nice, but not helpful with what to order. The owner kept her back turn to us the entire time, based on the pictures and news articles I read about her I thought she would have been more social. To what really matters we got #2 sampler and order of jalape\\u00f1o pierogies and the Ruben pierogies a lot of food for two guys. Really had no idea what to expect. Haluski was good, the pierogies came Luke warm and soaked in oily butter. Like the cab driver said you can find better. I'd pass on this spot.",

          "Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?).",
          "So I went on a marathon 2 hour bike ride right before heading to Enrico's for the first time and on my last mile all I could think was \\\"iced caffe mocha, iced caffe mocha\\\" over and over again.  Did I mention that I forgot my water bottle on my ride too?  I was a desperate woman at the end of that one.\\n\\nSo I got home aired myself out and drove myself to Enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there.  There was easy street parking right out front and I really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street.  Tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.\\n\\nSo why the 3 stars?  Well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar.  The syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery.  Could have been a better mix.  Would I give this another try?  Sure but I definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swig.\\n\\nThe coffee place at the Walnut Mall in Shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award.  Try the iced OR blended ghiradelli mocha when you are shopping Shady-style - AWESOME!",

          "Lately, the Rock Bottom is hit or miss. The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I've ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food. I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom.",
          "A few hours before the event, we happened across the ad in the City Paper and decided to give it a shot.  We were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery.  Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple.  Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something.  In the end, we chose not to spend the extra $15 to make another garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball.  \\n\\nWhen our 'instructor' met with us, he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear.  He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds.  Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything!  From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I would've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue.  Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn.\\n\\nWe then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats.  The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm.\\n\\nThe gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch.\\n\\nIn the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!).  It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals).  We would have liked to have a small 'info talk' about the steps that will take place, why they are that way, the tools used, maybe some quick science behind it, then get to work on the item.",
          "Wasn't terrible,\\nBut certainly wasn't great.\\nSave your hard-earned cash.",
          "You're getting an extra star for two solid reasons.  \\n\\nOne is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again (and a bit fancier).  Two, and thee most important part, this iggle has the best quality and well made sushi out of any Iggle's out there!  Believe me, I've eaten many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the Burgh and nothing has compared.  Dare I say, it's as close as you get to going to a good sushi restaurant.  Bold statement, right? \\n\\nI  just love me some sushi and want it often, quick and convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality.  Need a quick sushi fix?  This place is it!",
          "When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place.",
          "This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \\n\\nI only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr\\u00e9es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \\n\\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price.",
          "Ooooppss...update time.   Got the regular (steamed spinach and lasagna) from the hot bar on my way to work.   So, I'm on my dinner break sitting, chatting it up with a co worker while eating.  I see something white in the spinach just before putting it in my mouth.  WTF is that!  OMG, it looks like one of those fat ass worms we'd  pluck from the greens in my grandma's garden.  I threw the fork down and my co worker says...\\\" you're seeing stuff.\\\"  Um NOT!  I sat there digging through the spinach determined to find that damn worm.  Thirty minutes later  SHAZAM...found it. Ugh, my coworker spread open the spinach leaf.  EEEkkkk, it was bigger and fatter with black spikes poking out.  FUCK!  Call the manager at Co-op and he says...\\\"Bring it in for a refund, thanks for being so nice about it...We usually just see worms in the fruits.\\\"  Geez, thanks for that lil tidbit.    This happened last week around the Sept 14, 2010.  Guess that means it's really organic, huh?",

          "We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \\n\\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \\\"event\\\". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\\n\\nMy car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.\\n\\nThe Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv. I'd give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.",
          "I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole, hipster employees and presumptuous, anti-bourgeois customers that will literally push you aside a turn their noses up at you a million times. The rumors were true!!! \\n\\nEven though I was only there one time, first impressions are a bitch! The selection is great! I can't afford any of it, but it's great! I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...\\n\\nThe food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+\\n\\nThe employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen \\\"workers\\\" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating \\\"We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask\\\" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!\\n\\nThe other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!\\n\\nSo unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?\\n\\nI'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk.",

The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.",

          "Pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  The food is tasty but not transcendent.  The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  The food is essentially slightly hipper Olive Garden fare at double the prices.\\n\\nFor dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).\\n\\nPino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.

          "NO WI-FI.  Just FYI.  \\n\\nWhen I lived in Cleveland and my first (truly terrible) apartment had no wi-fi Whole Foods was my second home...I would buy a little sampler of buffet foods and salads, a coffee, maybe a vegan cookie, and park myself at a booth for an hour (or more, let's be real).  After I taught a yoga class.  I know, I know, I'm such a white liberal yuppie, it's painful.\\n\\nAnyway, so when the internet went out at my Pittsburgh home I trotted off to Whole Foods, bought some food and a coffee...and asked about the wi-fi.  \\\"We have it,\\\" said Cashier #1.  \\\"It's probably just under \\\"Whole Foods.\\\"\\\"  \\\"We have it,\\\" said Cashier #2, \\\"but I don't know the password - ask customer service.\\\"  \\\"We don't have it,\\\" said Customer Service, \\\"go to Starbucks.\\\"\\n\\nBelieve it or not, Starbucks is letting me drink my coffee & eat my vegan cookie and didn't make me buy anything.\\n\\nNO WI-FI.

          "I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \\\"The Hangover\\\" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \\\"The Hangover\\\" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.",
          "Went several nights in a row: Thursday, Saturday & Sunday. I cannot say enough how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!

They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well.

Our entrees came pretty quickly.  I had a seafood assortment of blackened talapia, grilled sea scallops and salmon cooked on a plank.  The scallops were just done, I like them cooked a little more.  Everything else was pretty good.\\nMy beloved had the crab cakes and really enjoyed them.\\n\\nWe'll probably be back, but will order something different.   We liked it.",
          "This location never disappoints!! Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. And it is awesome! ! Love this place!!",
          "I love shopping here. The staff is really nice, no attitudes. Even the other shoppers are kind. It's always nice. Thanks to everyone for making Whole Foods a nice shopping experience.",
          "Hello!\\n\\nI work pretty close to Whole Foods so I frequent it about 3-4 times a week for lunch. If you're there M-F between 12-1, you can find me in the salad/bread area (on the north end). \\n\\nCompared to other Whole Foods I've been to, I would actually rate it a 3 but considering I do not know of any other Whole Foods around, I thought it's my duty to those that do not know about Whole Foods a chance to give it a try. If the zucchinis at Market District looked a little weak, give Whole Foods a try. Plus their pre-made food is actually yummy.\\n\\nI'm able to keep my lunch on a budget by only buying lettuce and chicken from the salad bar (typically under 1/2 pound). I stash dressing, cranberries, and cheese in my office. I've tried buying the bag of pre-washed lettuce but I never finish them and I hate seeing them go bad. $3 lunches isn't bad at all.\\n\\nOther notes: The tofu chicken is really good (part of the salad bar)! It's not always available though. Also, none of their bread varieties impress me. I like their sushi rolls. If I could afford $8/day lunches, I'd probably have it everyday. I'd give their cashiers 5 stars. =)",
          "Yes, it is reasonably priced.  Yes, my food was tasty (6 on a scale of 1-10).  However, the place did not look clean to me--I won't be back because of that.",
          "Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  \\n\\nI was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.\\n\\nOrdered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back.",
          "When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\\n\\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \\n\\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\\n\\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\\n\\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\\n\\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\\n\\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\\n\\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!",
          "I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace.  Bad idea.  My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and \\\"Italian frites.\\\"  The latter, which the menu described as \\\"fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,\\\" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!\\n\\nAs a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a \\\"nice\\\" restaurant?  Classless.\\n\\nConclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's.",
          "Great friendly service and my order was done fast, which was amazing since I was a walk-in. Lots of toppings piled high but I wish there was more cheese. They did have small bottles of vanilla Coke, which is a rare find these days.",
          "I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  We literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering.",
          "I had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order. The food tasted frozen and microwaved. Nothing special just around average!",
          "I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).",
          "The grounds are very nice here, but I have to say the part I loved best was the collection of cars. I've never seen so many antique vehicles in one place. Definitely makes it worth checking out. However. The location is a bit wacky. It's right outside of Wilkinsburg, which isn't a place to visit at all. But still, it is nice enough to check out. Especially if you want to just go have a nice lunch at the cafe.",
          "We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server, was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.\\nBoth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink, I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back.\\nCan't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself.",
          "Horrifying.  This place should be ashamed of itself.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  Beyond dirty, just absolutely rank.",
          "I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people, I was totally disappointed with the service, food, and the place itself, I will not be headed back......ever\\nSave your money, or starve either would be a better option",
          "Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back.",
          "Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\n\\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.",
          "Among the best of the 'burgh.  Great live acts on a regular basis.",
          "So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \\n\\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\\n\\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\\n\\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \\n\\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink...",
          "We ordered from here because Uncle Chen, our go-to takeout place down the road, was closed. \\n\\nI ordered the General Tso tofu, a favorite dish of mine, and hubby ordered the beef Mei Fun noodles. We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.\\n\\nThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\\n\\nSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great. If you're looking for a quick fix to your Chinese food craving, this is a good place to order from, although I'll be going back to Uncle Chen before I try China Sea again.",
          "Good! I can't comment on the food or the bathrooms, but from what experienced it was great! The drinks were decent, and I  believe you must order two items at minimum. The staff is quick, but they should have more people working on a Saturday night. Before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchen.\\n\\nThe comics we saw were funny as well. Will definitely go back!",
          "We are fans of Pistella Beer Distributors simply because we needed beer one night while visiting some friends and family in Pittsburgh and they happened to be on the way to something we were doing.  It's a hole in the wall kind of facade but they do have a good selection.  I don't remember the price being that expensive but looking at the average review so far...it shows $$$$.  I'm sure they have some nice stuff, but we just got a case of beer (I think one of those Magic Hat variety packs) and it seemed similar to what we would pay in the other stores.  Anyway, we had a good experience with this place and don't really have anything bad to say about them.",
          "This place is cool!  But it is also 'cool'.  Service is so-so, but the staff doesn't have an attitude, they just aren't into serving.  And I'm not a vegan, but the food is so good that a carnivore like me doesn't even care. The menu is also huge.  \\n\\nFor those of you looking for an ATM- there's one a half block away if you just exit, go left and cross the street to the corer convenience store.\\n\\nI could always find a table and spread out with my books. Comfy, young, hip, worth it.  I wish they had alcohol.\\n\\nTry it!",
          "Really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour. No one wants to pay $8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality.",
          "Tonight's review: it started with a table for two stuffed between two other tables. Yes there were five other more comfortable two tops available. We asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request. Punishment was fast...we sipped our water, were provided a refill but no offer to acquire other beverages. With plenty of time to review the night's menu, we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had offended by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment. YES I will return and still recommend Casbah. Oh we did finally get to place a cocktail order.  \\nM",
          "Since both Marshalls and TJ Maxx are owned by the same company, I make sure to stop by both locations when shopping at the Waterfront. I generally find nothing or spend only $10 or so at Marshalls, while being enticed to spend at least $50-100 at TJ Maxx. The Waterfront TJ Maxx seems to have not only the same product as this Marshalls plus a whole lot more. All that to say, I consider shopping here a waste of time since I could just drive a block or so and be at a store owned by the same company that always has what I want and need. Sorry, Marshalls, but you're just OK to me.",
          "Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself.",
          "It was the first time that I went to this location.  We sat outside and it was a beautiful night.  I had the BBQ Burger with fries.  For the price of the burger I expected something much better.  It was a very thin burger when it came to the meat.  As a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it.  In addition, their drinks are expensive!  Just one cocktail could run between $10-$12 and they aren't very large.  Our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs.  There are enough restaurants at the Waterfront that I don't know that I will come back here.",
          "Dave and Buster's has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it. \\n\\nDining: 2 stars\\n\\nI had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \\n\\nWhen my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\\n\\nThe food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.\\n\\nBar: 1 Star\\n\\nDrinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\\n\\nArcade: 4 Stars\\n\\nThere are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\\n\\n\\nOverall: 3 Stars\\n\\nIf you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.",
          "DO NOT ORDER THE HOT WINGS!! If you enjoy eating hot sauce flavored gravy paste, then by all means these are the wings for you. If not, stay away. My boyfriend and i each ate one and couldn't even finish the rest of our dinner. Don't waste your money!",
          "I've been here twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner, and I'd have to say that generally, I'm a fan.  Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.\\n\\nI came back for dinner a month or so later.  We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.  And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu.  But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.\\n\\nThe menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love.  Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy.  When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass.  We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.\\n\\nThings got better during the actual dinner.  I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  It's just squash!  But somehow, it was heavenly.  My friend enjoyed her Cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  I tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  The only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  Actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  I tasted them too, and I have to say - it was off-putting.  Perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  Fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.\\n\\nWe also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  I didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  I enjoyed our creme brulee - because I enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  \\n\\nOverall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  I had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  But this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  I think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal.",

          "Love butter? Then get thee to Pierogies Plus.\\n\\nI live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer's freezer. Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.\\n\\nThe place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.\\n\\nOh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.\\n\\nYou also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.\\n\\nBesides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.\\n\\nAwesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.\\n\\nThe only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. A pierogi-less Allison is a cranky Allison.",

Then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cents, veggies 50 cents, Artery Cloggers 75 cents, sauce 25 cents. Those are the headings and they have items listed under them-like 9 different cheeses. You can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well. \\nMy burger was $2.25 after I added toppings. Is it the best burger I've ever had? No. But is it the best $2.25 burger I've ever had?  Yes. It's kind if a Russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked. Mine was well done and one if my son's burger had pink in the middle. We probably could have sent it back but we don't mind a little pink. \\nI love the tater tots!

Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. \\n\\nAppetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.  The texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right, sort of dry, maybe overcooked.  We had a bread pudding for dessert, which was probably the best part of the meal. I expect a better overall experience for the money.",
          "Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive!",
          "Absolutely Awful Service.  Went to Papa J's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly, rude and unhelpful..  Decided to try it again since it is close to Stage 62.  Big mistake.  Greeted by a dour manager that seemed mad that we had a reservation. 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  At one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  He said 'What do you want me to do about it?\\\" and said they had a busy night.  This is when tables around us sat empty. I then had to go back to the manager to give us our bill so we could get away from this ruined evening.  The bill was prepared incorrectly. If you want average food and terrible service, this is your place.  We will never go back.",
          "Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?",
          "I like this place but the hours are inconvenient (top roping doesn't open until 5PM during the week!!!!) I wish they would expand their hours. Otherwise, they make a nice effort to change their routes relatively often.",

          "I was here on Mother's Day with my Mom, my mother-in-law, my aunt, and my cousin.  This was a \\\"girl's day out\\\", a gift to ourselves (we left the menfolk at home!).  Afternoon Tea was absolutely exquisite.  Don't get me wrong--I love a good ballgame and hotdog just like everyone else.  But sometimes I gotta do \\\"chick stuff\\\" like this too!  \\n\\nWe took the tour of the mansion and the Frick Art Museum.  Current exhibits include The Road to Impressionism: Barbizon Landscapes from the Walters Art Museum and 1806, Jena, a significant late-nineteenth-century painting by French artist Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier.  \\n\\nThere is a lot to see and do at the Frick.

          "After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\\n\\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\\n\\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\\n\\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \\n\\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\\n\\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\\n\\nOh...but good food counts too. \\n\\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\\n\\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\\n\\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \\n\\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\\n\\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\\n\\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\\n\\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.",
          "I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront.  Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!  At least we didn't pay full price for the tickets.",
          "I went to this place because I had a LivingSocial voucher. Even with this voucher I feel like I paid too much money. I think I could have had better food if I went over to the Giant Eagle across the street and heated up a Lean Cuisine. I do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food.\\nThe only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. It was almost empty for a Monday at 7 PM, so if you are desperately starving, not able to go to better restaurants nearby or heat up food from your local grocer's freezer, this might be a tolerable food option.  Again, it is advisable to be desperately starving.",
          "I've been to Papa J's twice and had mixed experiences.\\n\\nBoth times I had the banana pepper appetizer, which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.\\n\\nFor entrees, me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.  I've had the fish sandwich (very good) and the eggplant parm sandwich (okay).  My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it, but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing. \\n\\nThe service is also a mixed bag.  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  The second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.  \\n\\nI would return to Papa J's, but I my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around Carnegie/Robinson.",
          "Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh was just \\\"okay\\\" for me. I really think that this place is geared towards children more so than adults or \\\"family\\\" because there isn't much fun here for people older than 16. The water slides here were lacking. There were very few of them and the majority of them are boring. The last time I was there (not too long ago) there weren't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide, so they really have some updating to do. \\n\\nThey do have an \\\"adult pool\\\" and bar area but it was so packed that it was hard to actually have fun in this area. The pool is very small, similar to one you'd find at a hotel chain. It has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max. and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in. It wasn't too impressive to me. \\n\\nThey also have a lazy river at this park and, while I do enjoy lazy rivers, this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe. People kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me grossed out. \\n\\nThe one attraction that I did enjoy was the wave pool. It was crowded as well but large enough to fit everybody comfortably. The water was nice and clean (a big plus) and the wave action was strong. I could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park.\\n\\nOverall, this place is just mediocre. It doesn't \\\"wow\\\" me very much but if you live in the area, have kids, and are looking for somewhere to go in the summer other than the mall, it'll provide them with a lot of fun.",
          "I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\\n\\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.",
          "I definitely got the best service of the restaurants on Ellsworth from this restaurant, and they also offer the best food for the price.  \\n\\nThe menu is creative and dinner (soup, salad and salmon) were delicious, but there is nothing that Portugese about this place (except the decor and a very sweet older lady hostess who may in fact be Portugese).  In fact, I think it would be considered a national security threat in Portugal to have a place that serves dinner NOT serve wine.  The government of this state is partly to blame though.  Since when did PA become goddamn Utah?!  But Rendell's gotta get his cut I guess...\\n\\nAnyway, the place is small and intimate, one server handles the floor.  Minus points for the lack of alcohol,and frozen butter with the bread, but this restaurant is a neighborhood gem.",

          "This place is great! Cute inside, great milkshake and hot and cold coffee drink options. We had the horchata was didn't taste exactly like horchata but was delicious. We ordered the bah mi which came with two types of fake meat on it. It wasn't a traditional tasting bah mi as it didn't have enough jalepanos, cilantro and it was much heavier but the bread was good and all in all it was a delicious sandwich. We also had the flower salad which comes with a heavy dose of kale and smoked tempeh. Really really good with the peanut dressing! Tempeh is soft and very flavorful. Will get again. Found out that they are closing/ moving to an unspecified location next week so we hope that they will be there on our next trip through Pittsburgh!",

          "My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty \\\"meh\\\" experience for me.  We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought.  It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\\n\\nI went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here.  \\n\\nI just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.  Buffalo Blues was neither.\\n\\nNot particularly interested in returning for any reason.",

Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \\n\\\"Would you care for some dessert?\\\", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.",

She said ok.  \\n\\nComes to be 5pm and I get a call from a guy at the shop asking where I was!  The lady who took my order wrote down that I'd be there at 5pm.  I explained that I never said that and picked the arrangement up a little before 5:30pm.  \\n\\nArrangement was just OK.  I specifically wanted a lot of orange flowers, which they did, but they added strange colors with the orange... and some of the flowers were already a little wilted.  \\n\\nEven though the location is convenient, I will probably go elsewhere for a flower order next time.",

          "I am very happy to be moving into a 'neighborhood' that has a line-up of decent mom-and-pop shops to find a reasonable meal when the cupboard is bare, or the energy banks are depleted for cooking. Bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and The Rusty Nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.\\n\\nIt's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. I've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.\\n\\nRusty Nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. In fact, I would imagine the Sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. As long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine. And indeed, all IS fine.\\n\\nSo few of our local 'diners' are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent 'diner' fare, that I can't call Rusty Nail a diner. It's a neighborhood family restaurant. Period.\\n\\nBurgers, meatloaf, pot roast, fish sammiches, salads, pastas...a varied but adequate menu. Fair and decent prices. Friendly and attentive service. A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. \\n\\nDuring my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!\\n\\nBottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood. \\n\\nBut do bring cash. The don't take credit cards.

The decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really? It claimed to be \\\"fresh pasta,\\\" but it was completely tough and chewy (not \\\"al dente,\\\" just undercooked), and not very large. I'm not sure when the restaurant changed, but I think it really missed the mark... People WANT a casual, friendly, affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to. Why take that away?",

In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \\\" we have to get to Pinos!\\\" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.   Sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!!",
          "Service has always been good and the food consistent, we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and there's some great deals on drinks as well.\\n\\nThings that stand out to me: veggie wrap, fried zucchini, hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter, and house salad with ranch (their ranch is so good I could eat it with a spoon)",
          "I love the Improv. I think its a great way to start or spend a night! Nothing like a laughter filled night. I think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way (Owen Benjamin, Pablo Francisco super funny Tammy Pescatelli not so much.)\\n\\nThings you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks. I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive. Their service is spotty\\n\\nThe wait staff is a little iffy. I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity. If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it but this time I was like no way!\\n\\np.s. when I used my groupon I didn't have any trouble",
          "Great location!  I love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread.  Love love love the smiley cookies :)",
          "I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player, runner, and sports fan, so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas. With that said, this is probably the worst Dick's location that I've ever been to. The selection is very limited for soccer gear, which must be a testament to the lack of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear. It's mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players.\\n\\nThe staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it's the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don't have what we're looking for). \\n\\nThey do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you're looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn't have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a \\\"good\\\" Dick's location.",
          "Some how even though the food at this Eat'n Park is down right abominable, the smiles and laughter is always there.  How can I stay mad when the prices or so cheep? Myself my boyfriend and his nephew had lunch with milkshakes and me having a coffee it was $31.00\\n\\nOn this particular occasion the fire alarm went off and rang and rang and rang loud and long for over 15 minutes before the fire department got there realized they didn't have key to turn it off and than another 10 minutes later finally shut it off...only at Eatn' Park.\\n\\nMy baked potato was hard as a rock, I had ordered two pieces of baked cod and only received one. \\n\\nThe waitress was very sweet and attentive and really attempted to build a rapport with our lil nephew which I thought was sweet.",
          "Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.\\n\\nTonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.\\n\\nI imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).\\n\\nAfter 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.\\n\\nWhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?\\n\\nThe food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.\\n\\nWe certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.",
          "Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience.",
          "Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old, cold, hard, inedible.  Sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish. I can't even believe that the server, let alone the  \\\"chef\\\" thought it appropriate to serve. \\n\\nBrought my 2 year old along, had to get a high chair, I'm able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one.",
          "Nothing matches in this place! The tables, the chairs, the tiles and that's how we like it! Lots of delicious vegan items. Definitely a good place to try new things. Good coffee too!",
          "For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.",
          "Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.\\n\\nNOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.",

          "Rocky's has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong.  Their food is good.  Not haute cuisine, pretentious!  Everyday, well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking.  I've mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room, but, today I introduced an old friend to \\\"linner\\\" in the bar.\\nHe ordered the large version of fish sandwich.  Rocky's is famous for their fish.  Three large breaded and fried fish filets, bun and fries for under $10.  Needless to say, he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate.\\nI ordered the meatball grill.  It was delish.  Served on thick cut Italian bread and made \\\"grilled cheese\\\" (mozzarella) style.  Meatballs and tomato sauce are both good!  Also, served with fries.  I brought home half the sandwich.\\nAnother good meal there.  Friends, mother, and former boss all enjoy their food!",
          "Can be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  We had a cheese tasting simply because I *never* pass up Pleasant Ridge Reserve when given the opportunity.  They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove.  Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...\\n\\nService was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.",
          "Chuckie Cheese for grown ups...Yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but I'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).\\n\\nFirst let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.\\n\\nThe building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\\n\\nSpeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.\\n\\nI will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first.",
          "Got the rancho and the Greek, not so bad but I probably won't go back... Too heavy for me...",
          "For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\\n\\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\\n\\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\\n\\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \\\"right out.\\\"  While I guess she didn't define \\\"right out,\\\" what this actually meant was \\\"in 25 minutes.\\\"  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\\n\\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\\n\\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \\\"Mac and Cheese\\\", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\\n\\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \\\"just the bill.\\\"\\n\\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with \\\"I hope you will join us again.\\\" I will not.",
          "I'm not too impressed with this particular Dick's Sporting Goods. It is in a great location in the Waterfront, but the selection seems a bit limited to me. They have what you need, but they don't have many options it seems.\\n\\nI went in there the other day and it looks like they also have a snowboarding section now, which they definitely did not have last season. They also have hunting, golfing and biking, in addition to the other regular deptartments. \\n\\nYour normal Dick's. Nothing spectacular, but it will do.",
          "I ate here this past Sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend.  I have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside.  We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.\\n\\nFor my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet.  Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy.  My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza.  Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Everything that I tasted was good and I would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast.",
          "Good food, great service, but high prices.\\n\\nMy date and I shared 2 appetizers, a salad and each had an entree with the recommended wine pairings. Bill was $115 without tax--pricey by my standards for this experience. The new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night. The bruschetta with fig and grape butter, prosciutto and blue cheese was good, so was the beet salad.\\n\\nWe were disappointed with our entrees. My roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot. My date had the salmon with potato fennel puree, which she said tasted fishy.\\n\\nMake sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.\\n\\nAlthough I would come here again, there are certainly much better restaurants in the city. I would rank Casbah below Eleven within the Big Burrito group of restaurants.",

I drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. Its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\\n\\nThe food is hit or miss.

And if you want them, you better get there early on the weekend! They're small, so get 2 for yourself at least :)\\n\\nWe've also tried the Nutella tart, which i've had twice now because it's SO DELICIOUS. The fruit tart is not bad, cinnamon buns are great, jewish pizza is ok (not what I was expecting - it's kinda like a fruitcake - like the dreaded holiday kind - but denser and drier), strata (eggy bread dish) which was pretty good, key lime cake - so so good, and quiche (good). \\n\\nSeating is hit or miss, since there's only a few tables (3 of them seat 4 people, 1 seats 2 people). On a quieter morning you should be able to find a seat. They serve coffee as well (nothing to write home about), $2 a cup, but if you like coffee with your dessert like me, it's nice to have.",

Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(",
          "This place used to have a great bar/tapas menu with a decent selection of happy hour wine specials.  Now...  not so much.  Well, during HH, you can get any of the wines under $10 for $5.  Selection by the glass is limited.  \\n\\nAs for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  I haven't really been disappointed yet!  The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends.  The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  \\n\\nOh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  And it is nice that you can order Veuve Cliquot by the glass ($16).\\n\\nPrices are a bit high for what you'd expect for Pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, I would recommend it.\\n\\nP.S. I have heard that they have a great brunch on Sundays. I personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments I hear, it's probably worth the try!\\n\\n-------------------------\\nUpdate 12/9/07:  Went to the brunch.  What a great deal!  For $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  The smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  The truffled potato was yummy.  The arugula salad was as delicious as ever!  And for entree, we both got the Casbah benedict.  I have to admit that neither of us was blown away, but it was good and filling.  I think that we will both be back to try other things on the menu!",

Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.\\n\\nWe started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.\\n\\nMy wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\\n\\nOur daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.\\n\\nI ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. \\n\\nThe kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hell's Kitchen. The waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.\\n\\nOn a different note, our waitress Susan was very good. Come here for drinks and the bar food. Skip everything else.",
          "I've been going here since I was a wee tot.  I have always enjoyed their food even though there's nothing too special about it.  I really like their breakfast menu.  You always seem to get lots of food for very little money, which is nice.  \\n\\nMy only complaint is that it is WAY TOO SMALL and always very busy.  They should really look at expanding the restaurant.",
          "The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.\\n\\nRather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.\\n\\nThe driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges. \\n\\nSo I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.\\n\\nI would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town.",
          "The times I've been here, its been an OK experience. However, their store hours are absolutely terrible. Closing at 7pm basically means they're never open when I would need to go there. Despite this being more conveniently located, Walgreens and Target end up getting most of my quick-shop business, simply due to late hours at night when I need to cook, clean, realize I'm out of toothpaste, have a headache, need a last-minute birthday card or whatever.",
          "Food was ok. Waitress was a huge air head. Waited 25 min for my $7.00 beer. Only got it after I reminded her. It is just another disappointing chain restaurant disguised as a local commodity.",
          "I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night.  I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  \\n\\nMy two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \\n\\nI ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \\n\\nThe service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  \\n\\nAdded bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).",
          "Old school.....traditional \\\"mom 'n pop\\\" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it.",

          "Aw it's places like this that make me love Pittsburgh. Its hodge podge decor and hipster crowd are what drew me here in the first place, but turns out the food and coffee is pretty decent even delicious. Since it's far from where I live I don't get to come here half as often as I'd like but I'm always pleased when I do. \\n\\nSuch cute boys.",
          "It's fun, but not as fun as Kennywood. The boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes on/shoes off events. The lazy river could be much better. I did like the water slides and the Potato Patch fries, as well as the scenic location.",
          "I am definitely the salt queen.  I literally salt everything from pizza, McDonalds French Fries (even though I know that they already have tons of salt on them).  I also salt ham and processed foods.   I always salt food before even tasting it.  Nothing is off limits when it comes to me and my salt shaker.\\n\\nWell when my beautiful meal arrived I asked my server for the salt.  None of the tables had salt or pepper shakers on them.  As my server went to get me the salt shaker, I took a bite of my potatoes.  Whoa!!!!!  They were extremely salty!!!!   For the first time in my life,  I didn't add any additional salt to my meal.  For me to say something is \\\"very\\\" salty.... It is very salty. \\n\\nBeing the salt queen,  I stll  was able to enjoy and love my meal.  I am almost guarantee that the average person would not have enjoyed this food..  My friend also tasted my meal and immediately noticed the heavy taste of salt.  However he never salts anything so something with one grain of salt on it, he will be about to tell.  \\n\\nIt really suprised me that such an upscaled restaurant would have this much salt added to their food.  I am sure that it was an error or something.  I have eaten here in the past and never experience so much salt.\\n\\nStill my meal \\\"for me\\\" was delicious.  For the first time in my life, I am glad that I did not add any salt to my meal.\\n\\n  I do love Casbah alot.  It is probably my second favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.",
          "I'm not into waterparks as much as I am into amusement parks.  I go to Sandcastle maybe once a year.  But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.  The main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the Sandbar and the Sandbar Pool and the Hot Tub remain open for the 21 and over set.  The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  Occasionally there's live entertainment.\\n\\nIt's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works.  But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.  There's even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.\\n\\nI'm glad I renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully, I'll get another chance to come back.",
          "My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon.",
          "Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  Seriously, I'd rather eat at the OG.",
          "Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped in simply because the Brugge was full, but I unfortunately won't be making that mistake again.",
          "Will I come here again?  Yes absolutely for drinks, they knocked the Ketel One extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park.  The ambiance is very nice.  Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt \\\"bad where I hope they improve.\\\"  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  We went with appetizers she recommended.  Not good.  \\n\\nSeared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  NOT good.  With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  The chef should do so.  (He's a nice guy like me I hope.)  \\n\\nBBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It is chilled, very delicious.  This appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce.  A real \\\"must-miss\\\".  \\n\\nCod entree was OK.  The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  Potato skin had grit in the mashed.  Why 1 star?  The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine.  I hope they spruce it up.  The place is nice.",
          "Great club/bar/lounge/venue. Great mix of people and music with decent bartenders and good prices on beer.",
          "I came here with a friend for her birthday, and the food really isn't particularly special.  Portions are decent, and I guess the prices are reasonable... if they had better food. \\n\\nThe outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring, but the inside patio area was pretty nice actually.\\n\\nOverall, I just wasn't very impressed with the food.  If I was offered to eat this food for free, sure, I'd take a helping, but probably not seconds.",
          "The Quiet Storm was great. I started with the soup of the day which was something along the lines of a carrot pumpkin curry. It had an unexpected texture but I still quite enjoyed it. For my entr\\u00e9e I had the Spinach Burger, which was quite filling. It is quite unique and comes with plenty of options for toppings. I couldn't resist putting cheese on the otherwise vegan burger, but still felt very healthy eating such a veggie-filled dinner! Their milkshakes also looked amazing - I would have tried one but I needed something to warm me up instead so I got a latte, which was also very good. One other thing I thought was neat was that the sell mixers and encourage you to bring your own champagne and/or vodka. I haven't seen that before, but it's a great idea!\\n\\nI was also intrigued by some of the other items on the menu, so I will need to go back to try more.",
          "Never received my order and was left in a bad mood. The driver did not carry GPS for delivery, did not know my address which is right in squirrel hill, did not listen to me (or did not understand me?) when I tried to give him directions, asked me to pick up food from an intersection 0.3 miles away from my apartment in snow, and finally yelled at me to cancel my order. \\n\\nCannot comment about food, but whatever experience I had left a bad taste.",
          "I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \\\"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \\\"chain\\\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \\\"bar-straunt\\\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).\\n\\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\\n\\nI've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\\n\\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.",
          "I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \\\"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\\\".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.",
          "Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service",
          "Nice place but some of the items on the menu are not available unless you get a 2 for 12 but that's not what the online menu states. And it's a salad come on..",
          "I don't frequent Bar Louie, and I really don't plan to change that any time soon. I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place.\\n\\nThe food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never \\\"wowed\\\" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\\n\\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.\\n\\nSo while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon.",
          "I guess I'm getting burned out on winter.  That's what made me think about this place.  See, as Julina below says, it's close to Frick Park and it's a wonderful place to pick up sandwiches, pop, or picnic supplies before going over there.  It's also a great place to sit outside with a cup of coffee or a cold drink or snack before going over to the Frick Mansion.  So you can stop here with your out-of-town guests while sightseeing.\\n\\nThis is truly a little out-of-the-way gem, located on a side street.  I haven't been up this way in awhile (I was also nosing around on Google Maps/Street View yesterday, so that's also why I thought of this place) so I hope nothing much has changed here.",
          "This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money, shop elsewhere.",
          "Talk about overpriced. $18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it. The latter was terrible, thin and flabby and rather unappealing. The pasta itself was ok, as was the sauce. The desserts are pretty good. But honestly, that is a $10 dish whose price has been inflated.",
          "Good beer selection. Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd, it wasn't her fault she was the only server. But it took about an hour to get our sandwiches. Mine was one of the best reubens I've ever had.",
          "If you must eat at Eat N Park, this is the one you want to go to. Why you ask? The corporate offices are right next door and the suits are there every day, breakfast lunch and dinner. \\n\\nWhen I spend a few hours with dear old mom, she enjoyed spending a day at the Waterfront, she loved the since closed 39 center store, where she could buy her monthly greeting cards for 39 cents each. Then we drive over to this eat n park where she has her breakfast smile and I enjoy an egg beater sandwich and fresh fruit.\\n\\nThis place is spotless, the salad bar always looks fresh and the food is good, for a chain.",
          "I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it!",
          "Closed.  Signage down.  Boarded up tight.  Phone disconnected.",
          "I haven't been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \\n\\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \\\"I have to go back for the rest.\\\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \\n\\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\\n\\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won't deter me from returning.",
          "If you have any common sense at all, please don't stay here.  Once, it almost burnt down...and I'm pretty sure most of the locals were chanting \\\"burn, baby, burn.\\\"",
          "I really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  First, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  I'm writing this review after going there twice.  The first time my husband and I went, the dinner was good.  We thought this place has the potential to be our go-to Chinese restaurant in Pgh.  Today I remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  The won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  The entree was fine.  \\n\\nWhat really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  The smell wouldn't leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as I could) to get rid of the smell.  Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?  \\n\\n[first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]",
          "It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  Everyone in the table resented me for \\\"holding back\\\" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.\\n\\nWhich hey works as a segway onto the burger.  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways.  The patty was sorta flavorful.  The toppings were in the bland category.  Cheese went MIA.  And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.\\n\\nA big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits.",
          "Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order.",
          "OMG who wrote the review below? A big fat liar/someone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls, and squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, so not the best, but for two hours, we could deal. We looked for bed bugs, and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest. After about 20-30 minutes, we both started itching like crazy. I ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders, arms, and legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut them down! It's deplorable in there!!",
          "This place is so hit-or-miss for me. Sometimes the food is amazing; sometimes it is terrible. Example: I ordered the spicy peanut wrap for the first time and fell in love with it. I came back a couple weeks later, and it was bland and unappetizing. Maybe there is someone who works in the kitchen who doesn't know where the spice rack is-- I don't know.\\n\\nThe 'waitstaff' is hit-or-miss, too. Sometimes, they're great. Other times, I've waited for ages just for a menu. One guy actually snapped at me for asking for a breakfast item at lunch. \\n\\nThat said, there are some good dishes, like the Black & Gold. I like that in some dishes you can replace rice with salad. A lot of people I've eaten with here have raved about the quesadillas. There's a nice laid back atmosphere and fun retro diner decor. There's also an extensive (but expensive) drinks menu with milkshakes, teas and coffee drinks, and a nice selection of locally-made vegan sweets and pastries. And I love the magazine and book rack, even though the magazines are usually two years old. Still fun to read.",

          "I cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable, and there are no fitting rooms!  One purchases clothes at their own risk!  What person would buy a suit under these conditions, hoping the pants will fit?  Unlike other stores, there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted, a rare cash only business.  To the reviewer who boasts that everything is 50% off every day, how is that a sale?  It is bogus pricing.  Red White and Blue, uggh!",
          "I would rather drive out of my way to another Home Depot than give this location my business. \\n\\nEmployees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them. Strike that... I'm certain they notice, they just don't care.\\n\\nI'm a pretty understanding person, but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit, it's time to go. There are plenty of HD's around, seek them out and skip this one (especially if you're going to have questions)!",
          "After further consideration, this store does not deserve a 4 star review. The Old Navy product has been pretty weak recently, which isn't the store's fault, but the severe lack of customer service doesn't help the situation. \\n\\nWhile shopping here on Friday, I was one of maybe 3-5 people in the store. I would practically walk into a sales associate but not even receive a glance or smile. No one working here seems to give an iota whether or not product is being sold. To avoid inconveniencing the associates, I will be taking my Old Navy purchases online in the future.",
          "This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here.",
          "I love bed bath & beyond! \\n\\nThe employees at this particular one are always available and helpful!  \\n\\nThe selection, plus the 20% off coupons keep me coming back, and its also where I get all of the things for my soda stream. \\n\\nOverall I will be back many, many times",
          "Waterfront Lowe's beats Monroeville Lowe's for lawn and garden.  Hate to admit it, but it's true.",
          "This local Lowe's serves its purpose for my husband and me -- a convenient home improvement store that we run into every month or two. I am most impressed by the lawn and garden section of the store. I am not sure how it compares to other Lowe's stores, but when shopping at the Home Depot in North Fayette last fall, their flower selection was dismal compared to this Lowe's.",
          "I mean, it's Target. It has everything. You just need to know what to buy there, and not get sucked into the convenience of buying everything in one spot.\\n\\nBeware -- though their merchandise looks nice, and it's a good buy for a student, you don't want to make long-term purchases here. The zipper on a skirt I bought broke the first time I wore it. I've heard horror stories about disintegrating comforters during their first wash.\\n\\nThat said, their store-brand toiletries and other sundry items are fairly cheap, and they have a wider selection than Giant Eagle or CVS. They also have a cool program with Flickr.com -- you can upload your photos, order them online from Target's One-Hour Photo kiosk, and pay by credit card when you pick them up.\\n\\nI love their cheap accessories -- glasses, bags, jewelry. Along with Claire's and Filene's, Target is my favorite place to shop for those things.",
          "Never again. Let me repeat, never again. \\n\\nThe primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\\n\\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \\\"guilty-until-proven guilty\\\" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\\n\\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.\\n\\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \\\"maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\\\"  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\\n\\nThe latest of many \\\"adventures\\\" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  \\n\\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they \\\"found\\\" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.  Hence, I am now here, writing this review.\\n\\nNever, ever again.",
          "Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff.",
          "Love the store. Great stuff, High price. Buyer BEWARE of the RUDE cashier SYLVIA, extremely unpleasant, unwilling to help and always with NEGATIVE attitude. She needs customer service training....Someone please tell her to stop complaining about other customers or employees....Cashier that does window display is always kind, friendly and helpful.",
          "Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.\\n\\nI will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.\\n\\nSo I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. \\n\\nI went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. \\n\\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\\n\\nSo I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying \\\"Soooo, you DON'T want these???\\\" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! \\n\\nAfter that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). \\n\\nThe thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever.",
          "Fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things.  I mean I know how to swing a hammer and push a button to start a machine, but all the other stuff...meh.\\n\\nI've only really gone in here to pick up paint, so I'll focus on that.  I feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter.  Each time I'm in there she always seems to be by herself with a line of customers all wanting there base paint tinted.  I don't believe there was ever a time I could just walk up to the counter and have my paint mixed for me.  Give that woman a hand.",
          "The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. \\n\\nI stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. \\n\\nPlus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront. I'd recommend checking other craft stores first. Unless you need glitter. Especially fine glitter. Michael's has the best glitter selection/quality of any store I've ever been to.",
          "Very bad purchase experience. I bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves, but they denied my request to return it. I am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore.",
          "Simply the best thrift store I've ever been to. Well worth the 3 1/2 hour drive from my hometown.\\n\\nFirst, and foremost, EVERYTHING IS 1/2 off all of the time!\\n\\nSecondly, bring cash. They DO NOT accept credit cards.\\n\\nThe store is full of wonderful pieces of clothing, all arranged by color and type (not by size, which is unfortunate). I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to high-end business attire to super-trendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful; Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, H&M. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the 80s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!\\n\\nThe clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plus-sized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.\\n\\nI went to Red White & Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of $7!\\n\\nCome to this thrift store; it'll make all other shopping obsolete!",
          "I love this place!  You never know what your going to find!  They have all kinds of things, that are usually slavaged from a home or business.   Kitchen cabinets, tables, mantels, windows, doors, tons of doors!   If your some one who likes to fix old things or make new things out of old stuff, you must go here!  I picked up an old dresser today for $10 its needs the drawer fixed and to be refinished, but when its done its going to look beautiful!  They have old appliances , bathroom sinks and toilets, lighting fixtures, wood, paint, counter tops, flooring materials, some tile, etc., etc.!",
          "Prices not great for true thrifters. Staff completely useless. No dressing rooms. I simply have nothing to say about this place.",
          "I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because another laundry place put me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs.  I thought the late hours alone should give it a star. Then I had this experience\\n\\n--Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. \\n\\n---- misleading advertising it boasts \\\"high capacity\\\" washers an says its air conditioned, well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were dripping in black dust and look like they were installed in 1963. which might have been why I felt an instant asthma attack coming on. \\n\\nThen the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting. Then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at 1030-11:00  pm at night so I can only Imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours. \\n\\nThen there was this guy I guess he was an attendant or the owner, he was wiping down the machines and dryers. I was moving my clothes out of the dryer and I had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer. I was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched them!!\\n\\nUgh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes. \\n\\nI come back in to check on drying clothes.... and what do I find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat. Now I am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load. All in all I spent 8$ at the econowash for 2 large loads I wasn't able to do my third load in the washers he had for under that. I can do that much at Laundry Factory around the corner though. So I will be going there. I don't need a creepy dude changing my dryer settings and touching my stuff.",
          "This place is bright and clean and I've seen staff taking care of machines every time I've been there (different times/different days) so I imagine it's well maintained in general.  Love that there are bus stops directly in front of and across the street AND that this is a 24-hour place.  I usually spend $7.50 every 2 weeks* though I could probably get away with using the single load machines and a few minutes less in the dryer.  I especially appreciate the good spin cycle from these washers as that means less time it has to be in the dryer!\\n\\nAround here, you can walk around the 'hood while waiting for your cycle to finish (pizza place, convenience store, coffee/ice cream shops next door, Border's bookstore down the block, more shops on Ellsworth nearby)\\n\\n*I'm a female doing laundry for 1 so it takes a while to have enough for separate whites/color load.  I've also been to The Laundry Factory a few blocks away and I prefer Econowash over The Laundry Factory.",
          "So I came to this Red White and Blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca, and I will get to how I left empty handed and in tears.  First, I'll walk you through my experience. \\n This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! \\nI couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). \\n\\nI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  \\nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.",
          "This is a bizarre CVS, the kind you would only want to go to in a pinch, and maybe not even then.\\n\\nI went to this one with my husband a couple of times to pick up prescriptions, and the vibe from start to finish is so weird. Let's start with parking, which is in a lot behind the store. There's not a lot of visibility to the lot since it is on the back side of the CVS. Being that it is a pharmacy, there wouldn't be a back door or windows, so the lot has a feeling of dangerous seclusion.\\n\\nInside the store, everything I saw told me that \\\"this is a pharmacy that is in a rough neighborhood\\\": shelves are only about 4'6\\\" tall (presumably so workers can see what people are doing in the aisles); bizarre things are locked in cabinets with clear covers (regular brands of shampoo?!); beauty items regularly updated, weren't (I, er, have a nail polish problem; some of the products were about 4 seasons behind and quite a few polishes were separated); it feels like there isn't enough room for the products, which are disorganized and crammed onto shelves (reference the odd shelf height limitation).\\n\\nIf you can spare the gas and time, there is another a CVS on Center Ave within a mile or so or a Walgreen's (Penn Circ S+Trade St.) and a Rite Aid (Baum+Negley) within 1/2 mile.",
          "nice and clean with well organized large selection but was expensive. I was looking for some twin size thin cotton blankets easy to wash and hang dry for my dog and the prices were $14.99 of course somewere high quality items which u would have to pay new retail store price $40-50 but still overpriced. I finally found a small blanket for $7 on sale.",
          "I can't believe I've been here multiple times and haven't reviewed it yet.  I absolutely love this place.  It's a super thrift store if you will.\\n\\nNo matter when I come here, I always find something.  It quite the experience.  I always make sure it's a day when I am off of work because I can literally spend hours here just looking.  It's a good thing that I do this, you can't just show up here and think that you will be able to gran an item and then leave.  \\n\\nLike a fellow reviewer said, there are not fitting rooms here, so be prepared to walk into someone trying on a potential great new garment for them self in the middle of an aisle.  Sometimes you just can't avoid this, I blame the fact that they have mirrors set up throughout stores.\\n\\nThey have everything you can seem to desire here.  Clothing to electronics, furniture to bedding, books to movies.  EVERYTHING is under this roof.\\n\\n*Cash only, ATM on premise.",
          "I love this store. I can just spend hours walking around getting ideas of things to either update or change around my house.\\n\\nAll of the sales associates are very helpful and knowledgeable. Sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you because they are busy helping other customers.\\n\\nThey even cut keys that actually work.",
          "Watch out when it looks like something is on sale.  They mark a rack or table with a big buy one get one or 50% off sign, then only some of the stuff on the rack is on sale.",
          "This store has changed hands many times over the past few years and it shows. Fifteen years ago if you didn't get there by 9am you would have fight a crowd. Now it never seems all that busy. Many of the store's best and dedicated employees left or were let go (about five years ago) and product lines change with each new owner. The most recent owner seems to be improving the store and employee turnover has seemed to slow.",
          "Oh Target!  You are big corporate America!  But how can I not love you so?  Your prices are the best whenever I need household goods like detergents, cleaners, etc.  For personal effects such as toiletries, soap, etc, you can't be beat!

          "I have to agree with Matthew U on this one. I do enjoy Barnes & Nobles but sometimes i get lost just trying to find a darn calendar. I went here after a dinner date with some neighbors and couldn't believe how packed it was. We had to wait 10 minutes just to find enough chairs to seat 4 people. We ended up stealing them from other tables. Not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minutes just to get an Ice tea lemonade.\\n\\nSo amidst all the books, newspapers and magazines they have an audio and video section. The prices aren't anything to rave about. I can buy the same movies online for a lot cheaper there's just the waiting period. I do shop here sometimes for there discount books. I found a lot of great recipe and mystery books for really cheap, like under $5. That's a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who has a great selection of books for literally half the price of retailers, how can you beat those prices. \\n\\nB&N is more of a hangout spot with books in case you want to buy one right there and then. But everything is kind of confusing you always need to ask where something is. I'd rather shop online for anything i really want. It's just not worth it to buy it wholesale.",
          "I have been frequently shopping at this Michaels store over the last couple months since I began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home. The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.\\n\\nI do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money! Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location. I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon. The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register. Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers, it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient....",

I've gotten huge solid wood picture frames for only a couple dollars.  The art prints inside were hideous...but I threw those away, re-stained the frames to my liking, cut new mats, and inserting art quoted as $360 each to frame at a big chain fabric store for under $30.  Boom.\\n\\nFinally, there is a decent selection of lamp to re-wire, always lot of furniture, some diamond in the rough clothes on occasion, and lots of other wacky stuff that's just fun to sift through.\\n\\nCASH ONLY and the cashiers are pretty rude/lazy, but that never bothers me.\\n\\nBONUS:  They pick up your donations for free from your porch.  http://www.pickupplease.org/  Super easy.",

I've generally been able to find what I need here and check out pretty quickly. \\n\\nIn addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most Targets, this location also has an optical department.

Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. \\n\\nABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt.

It used to be my \\\"go-to\\\" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  \\n\\nI stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not \\\"qualified\\\" for delivery to the store.  \\\"When will the items be restocked?\\\"  \\\"Don't know.\\\"  \\\"Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?\\\"  \\\"No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.\\\"  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really? \\n\\nThe staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  \\n\\nThe East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  \\n\\nVERY disappointing to me.",
          "Hats? They got some sweet stuff. \\nShirts? Stuff you won't get anywhere else. \\nSocks? They got you covered. \\n\\nGreat staff and cool location. Go check this place out.",

          "So, unfortunately I've had to outsource my laundry-doing in the last couple of weeks because the dryer in my building has broken down and my not-so-prudent landlord hasn't been helpful at all in repairs (ugh!!). Twice in the last two weeks, I've washed loads of laundry late at night and discovered my dryer hasn't worked. It's really great to know that this place is right down the street and is open 24/7, especially when the Laundry Factory down the street closes at about 9pm (which in general I much prefer to this place). But for convenience-sake, I appreciate this place. On the cons list, it's not incredibly clean and I have used dryers that simply don't work here.",
          "This was my first time to this Home Depot.  Very impressed with the customer service here.  We were redoing a bathroom and went in for more tiles.  They were out of them.  However, a staff member helped us use other tile and decorative pieces to compliment the tile we already had, instead of schlepping all the way to Monroeville to pick up the tile up were originally looking for.  We were very happy with the result!",
          "For someone who straddles the line between sometimes craft-er, this store can seem vast and confusing.  There's rows and rows of baskets and bedazzling jewels and paper and...oh my...scrap booking!  When I want to find boring old felt....it's like...where do I start?  \\n\\nI'm in a hurry, as always, and I rush in and the first thing I look for is an employee.  No one to be found.  I could call out and my voice would come echoing back.  I run between rows of paper, wood and gosh darn scrap booking....no felt!  Where do I find felt!  Where do I find an employee!?\\n\\nFINALLY, I find one after 15 minutes of wondering around.  She's incredibly nice and leads me to the felt.  This is not the first time I've been hard up to find help.  I tell her she was hard to find, and she tells me that they're \\\"low on payroll\\\" and can't have any one the floor BUT HER!  In that WHOLE store, JUST HER!  That's ridic!\\n\\nNot a month ago I was, again, in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out, with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line, I gave up and walked out.  \\n\\nHey Michael, do you pick up what I'm putting down?  You're not making any money because your costumer service SUCKS....in fact, there's no service to be found!",
          "Most of the home depots i've seen are the same and that includes this one. aisles full of hardware supplies, tools, bathroom accessories and even a small nursery for gardening. \\n\\nMy favorite section is the tool section seeing that I'm a DIY-er. (Do it yourself) if you didn't already know that. I enjoy building, maintaining and fixing things in my own home as opposed to hiring a contractor and paying a boat load. I'm best known at the Home Depot in monroeville. I come in there so often a lot of the employees know me just by my dog. Yes my dog, who i have brought into this store several times. They allow pets i'm assuming because i've never been asked to leave and I've seen others with their pets as well. \\n\\nThat's the best part about the store is the animal policy and the fact that they offer enough supplies for you to practically build a house. Some things are cost efficient while others are kinda breaking the bank. There not as modern as lowes but they have alot of the same products. I recently built my own in home bar. t's 8 by 2, a long bar that i (a girl) built by hand. I'm very proud of the work i did. I installed lights and polished it and it has a resin top with ceramic tiles beneath it. It's a real beauty and i got all the supplies at home depot. Cost me about $600 to make but i put it together in 2 months so that's a plus. \\n\\nBut yea if your in need of some nice plants to go in the kitchen or patio OR you just want to spruce up a few things around the house, then this Mega home repair store is where you ought to be. Between this and lowes its not like you have a choice.",
          "Went in here to grab a last minute item I needed for an outfit.  I wasn't going to hold my breath here either, I know it's a Marshalls and that doesn't always mean the best selection.  It's hit or miss no matter what you are looking for.\\n\\nThis day, was a hit, maybe even a home run.  I do have to admit, the Kenneth Cole shirt I got not only looked great on me, but made my wallet feel even better!",

          "This is a pretty good HD. It is somewhat smaller than the ones in Ross Park and Monroeville, but they seem to stock most of the same items. Occasionally I do need to go to Monroeville to find specific items, however. With a 1920s house, I spend quite a bit of time here for getting materials for repairs.\\n\\nCustomer service is about average. Some people are very helpful, others not so much. In general, they seem to be better than the Lowes at the Waterfront. At least HD people know where items are in the store. I can't tell you how many times I've received completely different (and wrong) answers to finding stuff at Lowes.\\n\\nI would prefer a small hardware store (such as an Ace) closer to me for things like nuts, bolts, and screws. Ace seems to have a better selection than HD does for hard-to-find items. HD has most of the basics covered, however, and probably a little cheaper.\\n\\nI generally avoid their paint section except for equipment. I prefer the service at a Sherwin-Williams or Masterwork Paint store. \\n\\nWe've had decent luck with their garden department. We've had to return a few plants that died the day after we planted them, but they have never given us any problems with returns. \\n\\nIt's a big-box home improvement store, for better or worse. It's a convenient location with a decent selection. 'Nuff said.",
          "I went in to get my suit that I bought last year tailored because I had lost some weight and I couldn't have had a better experience. When I walked in I was immediately created by Bill who was warm and friendly. Anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit. She checked everything, even changes I hadn't thought to have made to make sure the suit fits me perfectly when they are done. Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day. Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left. Everyone was extremely helpful and diligent and I will continue to only get changes done at this store.",
          "Such nice staff.  \\n\\nI really lament the decline of the modern bookstore.  I really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book.  \\n\\nThe store has a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind.  \\n\\nI really hope this store stays here for some.  The prices are also fair and often have great discounts.",
          "This is the best experience I've had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.\\n\\nAt Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.\\n\\nAlso, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you \\\"You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!\\\" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.",
          "I love love LOVE this store. I thought the one on Saw Mill Run was great but this was i think is way awesomer. If only awesomer were a word. I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, DIning sets, paints, sculptures and sooo much more. I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It's such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. \\n\\nSo the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find. The Store has certain days that offer you %50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited.\\n\\nThe clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. \\n\\nShopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift. If I had known that It was nothing like the Good Will I would have been here a lot sooner. Now my sister makes fun f me for going so often. What an amazing place this is!! I'll probably never shop retail again!!\\n\\nREMINDER: CASH ONLY!!\\n-But they have an ATM!! $2.50 fee",
          "I needed alterations done to my suit very quickly. Like three days quickly. Not only did Filberto at Alteration World have it ready, the price was beyond reasonable and the work was EXCELLENT! I plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now on.\\n\\nOh and he let me know that they also dry-clean. Wonderful shop!",
          "Woo Hoo!  Dead Lady.\\n\\nThis thrift store rocks.  I have been doing this for more years that I haven't been, and it is the best in the city.\\n\\nI would make a weekly trek to RWB, and would never be disappointed.  These were the days when you could find a vintage 50s something or other on the racks, before there was a \\\"Vintage\\\" section.  Still, recently, there is always a treasure to be had, especially in the housewares department.  The proximity of this thrift store to the affluent neighborhood of Sewickley accounts for its top-notch merch.  Whenever we'd have a particularly good day, my frends and I would joke...\\\"dead lady.\\\"",
          "What can I say, I'm a shill for Target!  Like another reviewer says, you have to watch the impulse buying here because it is so easy to do!\\n\\nBut as for the name brands here, I've never had a problem with them.  I bought some Woolrich blankets and sheets here that my husband and I have been very satisfied with.  The housewares section here is positively unbeatable.  My husband Rick is an amateur chef and he could blow his paycheck on the kitchen utensils.  He particularly likes the Michael Graves ones.  He is also an amateur photographer and he still works with film, so he likes the film development here.\\n\\nMe, I also like buying household cleaners and personal items such as soaps, toothpaste, deoderant, etc because the selection is so good.  I've also purchased a lot of my casual wear here.",
          "Barnes & Noble, it's like the Wal-Mart of bookstores.  Beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike.  \\n\\nI'm not quite sure whether I'm in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a CD shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.  With all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge it's a bit hard to figure it out.  Feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.\\n\\nI don't know about y'all, but I'd rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this.",
          "I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. \\n\\nI had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that? Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? \\n\\nThese people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. \\n\\nTheir professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic.",
          "Typical, but new.  \\n\\nYou see all of the people that are walking in and out and, I must say, the customers look like they work for a living hear.  I swear one of the guys was covered head to toe in soot.  That is amazing.  \\n\\nRan around the store looking for those few items that I needed to satisfy my need to build and create.  Minimal help from the small quantities of employees, but some of them actually asked if I needed help -- after I had found the item.",
          "As far as I'm concerned, Filene's Basement is good for two things: cheap dresses and cheap accessories.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a young performer, I need good-looking dresses for frequent auditions -- and I need a couple, so I'm not wearing the same thing every time. The dresses on the second floor usually range from $30-60 and are good for over a year. It can be hard to find a full-length dress that's not reminiscent of a prom dress, but their selection of cocktail-length dresses is ample.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as accessories go, Filene's tends to have cheap versions of popular trends. If I feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad, Filene's is the place to go.",
          "If you're looking for a wallet, a new cheap purse or something of that nature--this is the place to go.\\n\\nOtherwise, this kind of shopping just isn't for me!\\nI don't have the patience for clothes shopping here though.\\nThe racks drive me nuts bc they're in no particular order.\\n\\nIts \\\"Shirts/Sizes\\\", \\\"Pants/Sizes\\\", \\\"Jeans/Sizes\\\", \\\"Coats/Sizes\\\"\\nI can't look through a gazillion racks of shirts looking for something I like (aimlessly) in a M or L...

          "I go to this CVS all the time, since I work in the neighborhood.  I'm not a huge fan of it - I go mostly due to convenience.  Their greeting card selection is kind of lousy - I don't think I've ever found a decent card here.  I keep trying, every holiday or birthday, but every section is just full of duds.  Also, a lot of stuff is locked behind panels that you need the employees to unlock.  Like, razor blades.  And body wash.  BODY WASH?  It drives me nuts that I need to ask someone to open that shelf for me.  It makes no sense.  Staff is hit-or-miss with friendliness.  Some people are cheerful, and some act like they want you to go away.\\n\\nGood things - I love their coupon rewards.  I guess that's for all CVSes, not just this one, but it keeps me coming back because I get mad style coupons like every other visit.  And I had a good experience getting a walk-in flu shot from the pharmacy from the friendly (and quite attractive) pharmacist.  \\n\\nI'm just not crazy about the vibe here.  It just seems kind of depressing, with the stuff locked up and the smallish store with kind of a blargh selection.  I would much rather go to other pharmacies, but you can't beat this one for convenience (for me, anyway).  And they have a parking lot, if that helps you.",
          "I came here all the time while I was freelancing and in charge of my own schedule.  It has a lot of points going for it that other thrift shops consistently mess up.\\n\\n1. It's well lit.  You can SEE the clothing, see whatever might be wrong with it, and make an honest assessment.  You're never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you've just bought.\\n\\n2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. \\n\\n3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.\\n\\n4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.  You never know what you'll find.\\n\\nA summary of a few things I've bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker's bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....\\n\\nYou get the picture.  The prices aren't rock bottom, but close enough, and the quality of the clothing will help anyone but the stingiest person get over the 50 cents extra.\\n\\nCan't recommend it enough!",
          "Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!",

          "This is the best Giant Eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in Bay Area. Here's why:\\n\\n1. They sell beer!\\n2. Huuuuuge produce selection\\n3. Natural/organic foods section: cereal, pasta, soups, etc and fancy chocolate bars\\n4. Long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican, indian, italian, asian and , of course, jewish\\n5. Functioning bakery with fresh, appetizing breads and desserts (I am still loyal to Allegro Hearth though)\\n\\nThe store is huge and I haven't been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers, balloons, home/seasonal section, DVD rentals and a photo center as well as a drive-through pharmacy. \\n\\nIt seems as this GE just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes.",
          "This co-op is probably great for vegans and vegetarians, but I am Paleo.  I was very happy to find grassfed butter, raw milk, and cheese at reasonable prices.  The bulk foods section was missing a few mainstay items I typically pick up, and the meat selection was very poor.  I would like to see a better listing of which meat is grass fed and grass finished, as many of the farms in the frozen meat section did not have any of that information.\\n\\nFor my future needs, I will be ordering directly from the farm (this co-op sells items from the farm that I will be direct ordering from) at a lower price and will fill in the gaps elsewhere.",
          "My expectations for Whole Foods Market had been established as was growing up in the DMV (D.C., MD, VA) area. Thus, very fresh produce, high-quality meats, diverse cheeses, expansive bulk section, novel food items, exceptional food bars, and excellent customer service were essentially a given. On the other hand, I also expected parking difficulties, even at stores with multi-story garages.\\n\\nThe Whole Foods Market in Pittsburgh is not much different from those in the DMV area. However, the parking is horrendous! Really, a medium-size private parking lot for the only Whole Foods Market in the Pittsburgh area right along a congested major road? Let me say that Whole Foods Markets in D.C. are also close to major roads, but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers. I would love if the Pittsburgh store can build a garage of some sort (I'm not counting the garage next to the Starbucks and Walgreens) with smooth entry and exit so as to prevent a mini-gridlock along Centre Avenue.\\n\\nParking situation aside, the Pittsburgh store does live up to my expectations established from the DMV stores. You will rarely find a bad apple (no pun intended), and the store usually keeps shelves stocked (except when there is a major sale or promotion going on). Now, if only its prices and my budget could meet halfway so I could frequent this store more--via bike or my own two feet.",
          "I don't know why, but I just can't like this location very much.  I lived in the area for a little over three years and would always go to another GE before this one.  Maybe it's the way it's set up or maybe it's the way that the lighting seems so very dim.\\n\\nThe selection is typical for any GE, broad and expansive.  Some prices are a bit steep.  \\n\\nThis location, like many others, has expanded their pharmacy/health care area.  Which is nice, it saves an extra trip to a drug store.",
          "Yes, the parking lot in crazy. Yes, the prices are outrageously high (it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin'). Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. (Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). \\n\\nThe produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...\\n\\nThe HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. \\n\\nSome of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's \\\"chicken\\\" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. \\n\\nAs a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B! In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. It's next to sushi. It's very good",
          "the parking lot @ this wholefoods is an ABOMINATION!  to compound the issue, whole foods allows their purveyors to park on centre ave (a road that is already miserable enough to drive on) and block traffic. this past monday, a shearer potato chip truck was blocking the right lane. doesn't whole foods have a loading dock? i wrote an email to the district president and he had one of his store minions respond: \\\"you can park @ walgreens\\\". sorry, i am shopping @ wholefoods NOT walgreens. translation: whole foods developers were TOO CHEAP to buy the proper amount of real estate. dont even bother coming here fri-sun unless you like a clusterF*** lot full of zombies. this is the 5th WF i have shopped @ (4 in florida) wholefoods should have opened in the south hills. the demographics out there would support it. this wholefoods is BUSH LEAGUE!",
          "I been going to this place since the 90s and this place is the MIDDLE CLASS GE. I stopped going to this place since I got a job at whole foods. My mom went here a two weeks ago for the first tine in a long time she say that the people are still there and the place looks better and the people are a lot friendly now. \\nSo if you don't what too shop at a Middle Class food store in East Liberty then go to The Market in Shadyside.",
          "I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience, which is ridiculously horrible at this location - very poorly planned. And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium \\\"natural\\\" goods. Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. And I don't even need to talk about customer demographics, because you've all seen Rachel C.'s link!",
          "I agree with other reviews, this store is poorly laid out and honestly makes no sense. Sometimes bigger is not always better. I used to head here often while living near Shadyside to stop at the Family Dollar & hit GE in one run. \\n\\nI normally only stopped here for a Redbox movie. My debit card got hacked at an outdoor Redbox at a Get Go so I'll only go to a Redbox that is indoor like this one. \\n\\nAnyways, I'd hit up the liquor store for some wine afterwards for dealing with long lines/wait & awkward clientele outside.",
          "AH!  I am never shopping anywhere else for groceries ever again (except if I want like ketchup and bologna and stuff-- then I'll have to go to giant eagle.)  But, after coming from the middle of nowhere midwest, I cannot tell you how good it feels to see cheese and meat in the grocery store that I actually want to eat.  \\n\\nAH!",
          "There is nothing like this in chicago!  (that I know of).....I hope I get to stay in Pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage of this co-op.  I love the bulk section, especially since I can choose the quantity of what I want to buy.  Super convenient for travelers.  You can buy pasta, granolla, flour, quinoa, cous cous, cane sugar, spices, YERBA MATE!!!, dried fruit, nuts, olive oil, peanut & almond butter, soap.....man, I could go on & on.  You can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.  \\n\\nI was suprised that they had cacao powder, for such a small place.  They have a nice little section of tofu, tempeh, & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good.  \\n\\nThey also have a juice bar & vegetarian \\\"cafe.\\\"  I don't think I'd call it a cafe, more like buffet.  I wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked, but I'm not going to penalize them for that.  For such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there.  I really want to try something from their juice bar too!!  \\n\\nThere must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  Everyone was very curteous and nice.  I should try to make friends with these people since I'm new in town.",
          "This Giant Eagle seems more like a GetGo than an actual supermarket. As soon as you get in you want to get out as quickly as possible.\\n\\n You don't want to do any major grocery shopping here. For one, the prices are high. Secondly, this Giant Eagle does not carry everything you need. Who has time to run to another store? Just get your basic necessities here.\\n\\nAs for produce, it can be awful at times. Whenever I go to Giant Eagle Market District down the street, the produce is fresh and smells invigorating.  However, at Shakespeare, you are bound to find produce with wrinkles, open areas, mold and fruit flies- being sold at the same high prices. I can go to Trader Joe's and find much better produce for less.\\n\\nA pet peeve of mine is the self-checkout lines. Two of them are express lanes for items less than 12; the other lane has a belt if more than 12 items are being purchased. There should be TWO LINES but for some reason customers want to form one long super line, which holds up everything. The staff rarely sorts this out.\\nThe customer service is average here and I don't expect it to get any better.\\n\\nI only go here if I have to grab one or two items. The best times to go are early in the morning or late at night.",
          "This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be.",
          "I have been going to CJ since it opened. I try to go once a week. I have received some good deals there, but in the past couple years, the prices seem to be higher than they should be for used / overstock items. I find myself buying less items than I used to. I think if the prices were more reasonable, they would sell more.\\nA new \\\"reuse\\\" store has opened in the area nearby. They have more reasonble prices and thier building is heated.",
          "Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection.",
          "I loved Whole Foods in Ohio.  It was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce.\\n\\nHere?  Well, first of all, the parking lot is a death-trap full of upscale SUVs who have no idea how to drive courteously.  (A few pointers: use your turn signals, wait your turn, drive slowly in a parking lot, and put your cart back!)  My blood pressure skyrockets the second I even try to pull in here.\\n\\nSecondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark.  I don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's depressing.\\n\\nThirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice.  \\n\\nThere are a few good points, though.  The sushi (at least the vegetarian varieties) are good, and the desserts are delicious and beautiful.  The salad bar and prepared foods always look good, and the staff is friendly.  But I still try to avoid Whole Foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot.",
          "Compared to other Whole Foods locations, this one is tiny! For comparison, the Whole Foods in Las Vegas must be at least three times the size. Still, it's nice to have and it is pretty decent overall albeit pricey.",
          "This place has steadily improved over the years, and never fails to make me happy.  \\n\\nIt's stocked with every variety of weird hippie food.  It's also stocked with the best produce anywhere in the city in the winter months when Giant Eagle's selection looks beat up.  The prepared foods case in the back is deliciously weird.  And it's locally owned/operated, so you're not exactly sending your hard earned money to Whole Food's CEO.\\n\\nThe membership is lifetime, apparently, which the employees always kind of failed to express; I thought you had to pay for it yearly, and the difference is pretty big.   That said, I live far enough away that getting here regularly still doesn't justify the membership.",
          "I love Whole Foods, and I have been a fan for a few years now. I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.\\n\\nStaff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. \\n\\nThe cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. \\n\\nDeli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! \\n\\nThe tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. \\n\\nCheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. \\n\\nStore Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. \\n\\nWhole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. \\n\\nP.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here!",
          "As a vegan (since 2008) we are a regular at whole foods. It's convenient since we live in Lawrenceville. My one and biggest complaint is that they need to carry more (if not all) organic produce. Not this \\\"conventional\\\" garbage. Other than that they have a huge variety of products and grocery items to choose from. Staff is always friendly and helpful.",
          "Big Bang Bicycles is phenomenal! Amazing selection and service! I live in the San Francisco, Bay Area with plenty of premium bicycle shops available, but I do most of my cycling shopping at Big Bang Bicycles when I visit family in Pittsburgh. This shop carries top gear and has in stock tons of options so you can see, feel and evaluate them first hand to know what's going to give you the best feel and performance. Glenn, the owner, is very knowledgeable, friendly and you can feel his passion for cycling and making sure you get the right product and fit for you.  Even if you're not in the Pittsburgh area but you know what you want -- send your order to Big Bang Bicycles and I'm certain you'll have a great experience. Awesome shop! Thank you Glenn and team!",
          "I'll be honest, I just don't get it.  When it comes to eating I do not adhere to any particular mantra or dietary restriction like vegan, organic, vegetarian, ethical, etc.  If it's edible and it's within my palate's liking range then I eat it.\\n\\nFrom that perspective this place just gets two stars.  Some items were higher priced but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I guess justify it if you had to have it.  But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced.  So it feels like 90% of their inventory is priced at a whole-store experience premium.\\n\\nTheir prepared meals section was marvelous, and their cut fruit section was like I had died and gone to heaven.  But that's about the only two sections I probably would have been willing to open up my wallet.",
          "Forget Whole Foods when you have East End Cooperative! Honestly, this is quite possibly one of my favorite coops. They make some amazing deli items...so amazing that I went back twice during my visit to PA. I was only expecting to have a few options in the prepared food section, but the vegan options were plentiful. Their mock tuna salad was impressive, made with tvp, vegenaise, and spices. The potato salad was creamy and exceptionally delicious. And the vegan pasta salad was also impressive. Generally most grocers fail in this department, but East End excels by leaps and bounds. I can't believe how tasty their store-made food was. The prices were also very reasonable, if not low. If I lived in PA, I'd join their coop and would go there frequently.",
          "I think the only thing I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers.  Let's see why.....\\n\\nI attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  \\n\\nSo I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).  So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds.  But then I decide to buy \\\"fresh\\\" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try.  (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it.  Gimmie my Jif.)  So while I am waiting in line, I see the  bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere.  \\n\\nRegardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my \\\"whole food\\\".  And at least I put my cart back.",
          "I just found this place a month back and I'm kind of blown away by how awesome it is. Fresh produce, awesome prepared salads and dips, bulk everything, natural cleaners, and plenty of hippie garbage you can't help but fill your shelves with. The best part is that they try to stock up with locally sourced produce, milk, and meat. And you can get a good discount if you purchase stock in the co-op.",
          "This is a good co-op, with a generous selection for it's smallish size. Prices are better here than in some co-ops I've shopped at. Competitive with the big boxes, as far as I can tell. I have tried some hot-bar/cafe items and quite liked them. The java jolt smoothie is amazing, as is the lemon pepper tofu sandwich!\\n\\nIf you can judge a town by its co-op, which I am prone to do, Pittsburgh proves to be a decent place to be a conscientious vegetarian shopper.",
          "TimeBomb is without a doubt the best spot in Pittsburgh to get all the exclusive Raw street merchandise. This is my favorite store in the city not only because of it's selection of merchandise, but for it's uniqueness. \\n\\nThe owner Brick who started the store in '95 I believe is a great guy who always takes care of his loyal customers. I've received free apparel, stickers, DVDs, mixtapes, you name it from Brick. He's a man who knows how to keep his customers coming back! \\n\\nAll in all TimeBomb is the place to shop in Pittsburgh if you're looking to \\\"Get Your Life Right\\\"",
          "Great selection of vegan, vegetarian, raw milk, prepared foods, bakery, cheeses and aged beef. Very expensive, trader Joe's and Market district come to mind as a cheaper alternative. Parking at this particular store is a nightmare.",
          "This place has amazing selection when it comes to some things and zero selection when it comes to others.  We popped in here a couple times over the weekend I spent in PIT and both times they didn't really have what we were looking for.  Visit #1: Liquid smoke.  Visit #2: Hawaiian rolls.  I know these items must exist in PA just not @G-Eagle.  \\n\\nThey did however have crazy selection when it came to things like....corned beef brisket or anything that has potato in it.  My californian mind was boggled by the variety of brands and cuts of corned beef that were available.  Too bad that wasn't what I was there for.",
          "Lots of great vegan, local, organic, gluten-free, and/or raw food, though some items are quite pricey. Very good rotating-item hot bar for take-out lunch or dinner. Great bulk food selection, including diverse reusable glassware of known tare weight. Fresh fruits and vegetables are right-priced, but processed items like meats, cheeses, and frozen items can be surprisingly expensive. Fairly comprehensive selection, akin to a Whole Foods.",
          "I like this Whole Foods location. I will tell you why.\\n\\nMany Yelpers have docked stars for the parking lot. I think that's irrelevant. The parking lot, which is actually shared by Starbucks, Wine & Spirits, Walgreens, PNC, and more is two levels and is enormous! Walk a little. You can even take your cart up the elevator.\\n\\nThe Pittsburgh location is not a superstore. Other Whole Foods have a restaurant, brick oven pizzas, smoothie bar, coffee bar, many more food bars, wine, beer, and so forth. This is a teeny weeny Whole Foods. For its size, the selection is pretty impressive. For example, my mom saw something on Dr. Oz called Lingonberry Jam and asked if I would look for it, and there it was. Never heard of it before, but they had it. \\n\\nWhole Foods has that \\\"whole paycheck\\\" reputation. Granted, this is true if you're spending your whole paycheck on rare, gourmet, specialty foods! If that's the case, you might want to rein in your spending a little. \\n\\nI actually took a notebook to Trader Joe's, Giant Eagle, and Whole Foods when I first moved to Pittsburgh to compare prices. Giant Eagle (Greenfield location) was the most expensive by an overwhelming margin! Trader Joe's was the best value overall, but Whole Foods was very close, and sometimes a little better quality might be worth it. Their 365 brand is especially reasonable for your regular grocery staples.\\n\\nAs for the occasional splurge, this is a good place to try something different. I admit it's hard not to get something extra, but I know I can only blame that final total on myself!",
          "There is nothing better than a neighborhood market, and Frick Park Market fits the bill. Come here for grocery staples, a great homemade sandwich (get the breakfast sandwich, any of them!), or just to hang out. The owner will be there & is happy to talk to you.\\n\\nThe best part about the market, though, is when the kids get off school & come into the store for candy & soda. You can tell that the business is connected to the neighborhood and that everyone gets along. Pittsburgh treasure!",
          "Parking is tough, the food selection is great, and if you call ahead they will set aside awesome moving boxes for you.",
          "I don't know, maybe I'm not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...\\n\\nI have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.\\n\\nThier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is Pennsylvania.  You can't buy those things at the grocery store.  \\n\\nI can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes, even better quality.\\n\\nI guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  I'm not slamming Whole Foods at all, but I actually like Trader Joe's better.",
          "Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. There was honking, some road rage and confusion. But I will say that I should have known better coming into a grocery store before a major partying holiday.  \\n\\nAnyway, in terms of produce this place is awesome. I got my meat and bacon from this joint and have not been disappointed. I also love their premade hamburgers. They are delish. This is also a great place to find a great assortment of cheeses and grass fed butter ( I go for the kerry gold products, they are just awesome).  \\n\\nAlso if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container.  This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap. Overall, whole foods is not cheap, but if you want quality this is the place to go. Just dont go here on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve... you'll end up ripping your hair out!!",
          "I love everything that Whole Foods offers, but I can't stand the experience of going there. The parking lot is a mess of aggressive drivers acting like the extra 50 feet of walking will negatively affect the environment more than their driving around the parking lot until a better space opens up. Once you get a space and finally get inside, the experience mirrors that of the parking lot. Everyone is in each others' way and trying to be the first one to find the best organic orange or grab the last package vegan general tso's in the store.\\n\\nTo be fair, though, the experience is still 100 times better than going to the Market District a few blocks down the same street. Similar in-store and in-lot experience, but with a better and higher-quality selection. The staff is always really nice and super helpful, and their trays of fruit and veggies are excellent. We've ordered them countless times for parties and have never been let down. Pricey, but excellent quality. The prepared foods are delicious, and their prepackaged prepared foods are also really good...but like nearly everything else in Whole Foods, a little pricey. For example, their yummy tomato bisque is $7. Hardly cheap enough for a quick lunch, but it is yummy. Their baked goods are delicious as well. We're constantly picking up bread from there (and the occasional doughnut), and we're never disappointed.\\n\\nTheir meats and seafoods departments are also excellent. They have a great variety and are always helpful in answering any questions that I've had (although we still opt for our meats from DJ's). Of course, if you're at Whole Foods your'e likely there for the organic options, and as to be expected, you're not going to find a better selection anywhere else. More unique, perhaps, but their inventory just won't be matched any time soon for those foods. Surprisingly, third-party & prepackaged pricing is actually on-par with Giant Eagle, so whenever we're looking for those types of items (milk/eggs/pastas, etc.), we always opt for Whole Foods.",
          "So..... when I think about shopping at Whole Foods, I always create an alternate universe where I think I would be able to shop here. I think: if I made at least twice the amount of money I currently do, I would be able to be a member of the club and shop here. .... but I don't. Thus, I only stop in here on very special occasions when I 1. can withstand the rage I feel when I pull into this parking lot; and 2. I want to either eat at the buffet or buy a very specific item. I would definitely recommend that others stop in sometime to get some food at the buffet. The quality of everything is pretty incredible (though of course it's typically really expensive).",
          "Another store which has gone the way of the Dodo bird. Actually there was nothing basement like about it. What will be done with the empty space that is the question?",
          "I prefer this store to the Market District on Centre. It's just as overpriced and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy, but carries less products to sift through when you just need to grab some simple things, hopefully not produce. Parking is easy and you can hit up the unpretentious Wine and Spirits in the same stop. I think this plaza still exists to prevent impoverished people from venturing into the other newer fancier stores which are a mere half mile away and designed to appeal to people who think they are cultured and discerning.",
          "I cannot in my life understand why this Giant Eagle, of all the Giant Eagles, would get a five star rating.  From the moment you walk into here it's like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time you're in there.\\n\\nThe set up is ridiculous.  I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.  Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had.  It's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever.  \\n\\nHonestly, I only went here because I was at Target and didn't want to venture any further to complete my shopping.",
          "oddly enough, of all the giant eagles i have visited in pittsburgh, this is the only location that carries the toothpaste that i've used for most of my life (outside of pittsburgh). the location is clean and the staff are friendly.  i sometimes resent having a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment, as many of the items that i buy there are severely overpriced. but whenever i run out of groceries and toothpaste at the same time, i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here, although they may not carry all the groceries that i'd like.",
          "Everybody, chill out.  This is a trendy place to shop, yes, but it also has better prices on some things than Giant Eagle or Trader Joe's (Gasp!).  I split my time between Here, Giant Eagle and Trader Joe's pretty evenly, depending on what specialty items I might need.\\n\\nOh yeah, don't drive here.  Walk, ride your bike or take the bus.  If you're really smart, you'll avoid the headache and park on one of the many adjacent side streets.",
          "I stopped by here on my way home from whole foods market. They had just paved there parking lot which can only fit 3 max cars at a time. It was not as big as the one I normally shop at in Penn Hills. They are a beer distributor and have a way hugger selection. But they serve all of penn hills so go figure.\\n\\nI was looking for a gluten free beer which they had four kinds including cider. The prices were crazy expensive. $35 for a 24 pack of cider. NO way!! \\n\\nI had to buy it though cause it was sunday at 4:30 and all the stores close at 5 so i had no choice. I should have waited but i drove all the way here to get it so I should just buy it while i'm there. Aside from the money issue this place was just ok to me.",
          "everything is a cluster.  the store.  the parking lot.  the people -- customers included.  full-on cluster. barely any parking for a massive, heavily polluting pick up truck.\\n\\ninside: avocados are the price of gold, and there are no goddamn vegan taco spices at a place that's supposed to be so fancy.  \\n\\nmeh.  go to market district where they keep it real.  real classy!!!",
          "This store is great - it's got all of the fresh specialty items we need for cooking great weekend meals for friends, but isn't a vast, overpowering warehouse. Items are well organized, and easy to find. As others' state, it ain't cheap! \\n\\nOne way we lowered our Whole Foods bill was to go for their 365 in-house brand, which is typically priced at the same pricepoint as similar items in the regular chain grocery stores. We don't use Whole Foods for all of our supermarket needs, just the specialty items, great produce, and seafood.\\n\\nI docked two stars for absolutely terrible parking - yep. I know that's harsh, but every time we come here, we need to factor in another 10-15 minutes to get a parking spot and be able to leave safely (there are always cars behind us looking for a spot when we are trying to leave, and so we often can't just pull out of the space and leave quickly...) Even being careful, we have almost been hit multiple times by people losing their cool with the terrible parking.\\n\\nThat being said, we will continue to come here to stock our home when we plan to entertain at home.",
          "Kind of small, but I've had excellent luck with produce here: fresh and organic. In-store coffee bar is a nice plus.",
          "As a displaced west-coaster, I appreciate a store like this in Pittsburgh. \\n\\nI like the bulk goods and spices because you can take as much as you need, you get the spices whole and they put them in big jars so you can sniff them if you want before you buy (the downside to that is that every time the jars get opened the spices probably lose some oils), and there's a huge selection. \\n\\nThis place has my quinoa, pearled barley, spelt flour, and nutritional yeast. \\n\\nSome of the vegetables pop out at me and I'm tempted to buy a lemon or some really ripe piece of fruit. Usually I don't though. During the summer they were selling fresh herbs in pots. That was really tempting. Once they sold kittens. That was amazing. \\n\\nIt doesn't hurt that its right by the climbing wall, fencing, gymnastics, and bike shop.",
          "I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has.  Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\\n\\n1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.\\n\\n2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   \\n\\n3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\\n\\n4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\\n\\n5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\\n\\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.\\n\\nAlso, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\\n\\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed \\\"the dirty bird.\\\"  Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.",
          "This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market, and was pleasantly surprised with the selection. I got Beemster Vlaskas, an amazing Gouda. Very large parking lot.",
          "Oh Whole Foods, you are so so very overpriced.  I so so wish you were not, because I love the idea of the place.  But I just cannot bring myself to do my normal grocery shopping here.  I can't bring myself to spend the big bucks!\\n\\nThe place is always packed and you're usually left bumping into people left and right.  You may even get a nasty look, yikes!  The parking is atrocious, with only probably only 75 spots for a pretty popular store.  And have fun just getting into the parking lot from Centre.  Okay, I'm going to a negative place right now....\\n\\nI stop in here one a whim when I'm out in the area if I'm really craving sushi, because it's way better than the Giant Eagle's sushi down the street.  It's still not he best fast sushi (Giant Eagle Waterfront), but it does the job.  Again, they're almost $3 more than at GE.  When I run in to grab sushi and usually ad Odwalla by bill comes to almost $20!  I'd rather eat a fast meal at Qdoba...sorry...I said it!\\n\\nMy feelings can best be summed up with this....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UFc1pr2yUU",
          "This store is pretty good. Yes it is fairly expensive but you can get quite a few items that are difficult if not impossible to find at other stores. They have a nice meat department with quite a few good naturally raised products, particularly beef. We've been very happy with their produce, which we find noticeably better than Trader Joe.\\n\\nI wish it was bigger so there was a larger selection and a larger prepared food selection (we are used to the larger stores in Chicago). Also wish there was a liquor department but I'll probably have to run for state office for that. Frankly the worst part is often parking. Don't know what causes everyone to behave badly in their lot (myself included) but man it can be a mess. \\n\\nAnyway we'll keep going at least for meats and produce.",
          "It's not the greatest Target of all time but it still meets all of your basic needs.\\n\\nIf you're looking for produce, lower prices, and bigger selection in every department then head to the Target in East Liberty.",
          "Worst parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged, self-important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation (allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one). Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try $5, for real. If you want to sum up Whole Foods, just remember it's a place where you can literally spend $5 on an apple. Also, the CEO John Mackey voted for MItt Romney (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/john-mackey-the-kale-king.html?_r=0), so if you think you're shopping in a mecca of neo-progressive, pre-utopian bliss, think again.  Waste of time AND money overall.",
          "local, friendly businesses serving a great product DO still exist.",
          "Whole paycheck is a fitting name.\\n\\nThis Whole Foods is decent for regular items but their prepared food prices have gotten really high as of late.  \\n\\nI used to shop here for almost everything but their common products can now be had at almost any other grocery store for less.\\n\\nWhole Foods had it's day as a unique place to shop with hard to find organic produce and products. \\n\\nNow it's just more expensive.",
          "Nice Giant Eagle, not as nice as their new Market Districts, but you can look at this Giant Eagle and see how they came up with the Market District Idea and rolled with it. Fresh made sushi, good cheese selection, awesome bakery.",
          "I am a big fan of the Whole Foods company in general.  The store back home (Omaha) had a wine bar, espresso bar, gelato, sushi and udon stand, a GIANT cheese counter where you could sample...I could go on.\\n\\nThe Pittsburgh Whole Foods is small, and almost as overcrowded as its parking lot.  Two-thirds of the time they are out of what I came for.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying THAT much for groceries, I want a stellar shopping experience.  This WF is mediocre at best.",
          "It's disappointing that you got lukewarm service, Erina.  I've had pretty consistently good vibes (har har--get it?--hippie reference) there from the staff, who've been enthusiastic about helping me find what I need.  Hands down, this place beats Whole Foods for price and general atmosphere, and their salad and hot bar is my go-to when I don't feel like cooking.  Absolutely GREAT bulk section with a wide variety of grains, legumes, and pastas.  Killer cookies and baked goods.  \\nOn the other hand--if I lived on my own, I could do all my shopping here.  But, since I don't--I can't.  It's tough to stock a household kitchen solely from the EEFC--I mean, I can't really afford to regularly buy $15 laundry detergent.  \\nRealistically, the Co-op can't serve most of us for one-stop shopping.  But it's worth it to put down a few extra pennies for potatoes or juice to support a genuinely community-oriented business.",

          "Just wanted to write a review based on my experience today.\\n\\nEverything I went for was in stock today (which doesn't always happen). The place was crowded, as usual, but the line went fairly quickly. On my way in, I saw a $5 fish sandwich with creamy coleslaw advertised outside. Three guys were there cooking. Looked and smelled delicious, so I paid inside with my groceries. When I came out, I told the guys I bought one. They were really nice and asked me what kind of bread I wanted and what I wanted on the sandwich.\\n\\nSome lady that was \\\"in a rush\\\" was upset her sandwich wasn't ready when she came out (but they explained the fish was cooked, but they couldn't set up the sandwich without knowing what bread or toppings she wanted). Just watching the way they dealt with this customer was great for me. The guys were so friendly and patient.\\n\\nAlso, the sandwich was delicious! The coleslaw was also awesome! Yay! I am so happy I stopped by when I did.",
          "I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.\\n\\nAfter my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to \\\"apologize\\\". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would \\\"never salt his steak again\\\". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. \\n\\nThe drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. \\n\\nOverall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have.",
          "This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked \\\"doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture?\\\" she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn't even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers.",
          "Despite my 3-star rating, I think I will be coming back here again to give it a second try.\\n\\nI got the smashed potatoes with seitan, cheese, and aioli.  The first bite was OK--the aioli didn't quite suit my taste, but everything else worked pretty well together.  However, 20 some-odd bites in to the dish, the flavors were getting repetitive and the mushy texture started to gross me out.  I got about half-way through eating the dish and the so-so aioli became too much for me.  I couldn't take another bite.\\n\\nHowever, my wife's apple panini was delicious.  I would probably eat a few of those if I came back.  The cream cheese, cinnamon (from the bread?), and apple all worked together in glorious harmony.\\n\\nOn a strange note, while we were eating, some camera guys came in and started setting up what looked to be an interview.  We asked the staff what was going on.  Apparently someone was filming their submission/application to be on a reality show.  \\\"Oh cool,\\\" we thought.  \\\"What reality show?\\\" we asked.  \\\"Not sure, something on the Golf Channel,\\\" they replied.  HAHAHAHA!  I thought watching grass growing on TV was boring enough.  Now they're making a reality show about it.\\n\\nIn the end,  the gross aioli was inexcusable to me.  Otherwise, I'd probably go 4 stars.   I still plan to come back and give it another shot.",
          "I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\\n\\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\\n\\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\\n\\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\\n\\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\\n\\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \\n\\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\\n\\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \\n\\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \\\"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\\\" Well, that didn't happen.\\n\\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \\n\\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\\n\\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\\n\\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.",
          "This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving the service one. We didn't eat anything so I can't comment on the food. \\n\\nMy husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.\\n\\nThe bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\\n\\nShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.\\n\\nTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. I used to work as a server so I could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. I will NEVER go back.",
          "I've been to Buffalo Blues a few times at Happy Hour, and met my daughter there last night for Happy Hour specials as advertised on the web site.  First clue:  no Happy Hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the Yeungs and Wings (which was not what we were looking for).  We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture.  Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.  I think we're done here.",
          "I was SO ready to like this place!  Turns out, not so much.  It was okay.  No better than TGIFridays, but better than Eat n Park!  The deets.\\n\\nThe hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \\\"just to be sure.\\\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.\\n\\nHub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \\\"fine.\\\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!\\n\\nThe tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.  We'll hit the Improv again - we have before - but, we'll head somewhere else afterwards.",
          "Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\\n\\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\\n\\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\\n\\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\\n\\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\\n\\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\\n\\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \\n\\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \\n\\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\\n\\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\\n\\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\\n\\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\\n\\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\\n\\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.",
          "I came into Quiet Storm not intending to have lunch, but just a latte and hang out to answer some emails for a little while (working from home makes me stir crazy, so bouncing around local coffeehouses, completely NOT fitting in with the crowd kinda makes my day sometimes). \\n\\nI walked up to the bar and was just going to grab a seat there, but super hipster server guy asked me to take a table, because it had an outlet to plug my laptop in. I didn't need to, but  ... good lookin' out. \\n\\nAnyway, ordered my latte - good espresso, but pretty weak foam. Served in a pint glass. That's fine. \\n\\nMenu actually looked really good, so I went for a sammy with apples, seitan sausage crumbles, and cheese. They offer different sides, but my super hipster server guy didn't ask me what I wanted; so being a newbie I figured maybe that was only with certain menu items. I was wrong, when the guy taking care of the table behind me was asked what he wanted. My fault for not speaking up. Sandwich was good, not to die for though, and frankly kinda small for $8. \\n\\nI'll finish with this: Internets are free, right? So, where's the code? Did I need to ask??\\nI'll definitely go back though, intrigued by a few other things on the menu (like bbq tenders and pulled 'pork' quesadilla), and hopefully be a little more impressed.",
          "The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.\\n\\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    \\n\\nSecond, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. \\n\\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    \\n\\nOverall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.",
          "just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction.  normally, i have had the best experiences there. . . all have been very cooperative and helpful.  but, i guess they are so successful that they are becoming arrogant.  here's the rub:  my hubby sent me a picture of a chandelier they had; i did not see the picture until 30 minutes later; by then he had left the store.  i called to BUY the chandelier over the phone.  this has been done before (we WERE construction junction junkies).  the lady adamantly refused to help me. she adamantly refuesed to even listen to a description of the fixture!  she gave the following excuses:\\\" well, if you have been here in the last 12 years, you know how this place works\\\";  \\\"I can't go back there and try to find out what you want\\\"; \\\"i am the only one on the floor\\\"; \\\"this is first come, first serve\\\"; \\\"if your husband comes in and it is still here, then we'll sell it to him\\\"  \\\"how will i know which one it is - we have so many back there...\\\" .... i could hear the smirk in her voice as she enjoyed blowing me off. . .  i even offered to send her the picture my husband sent me via email - she refused.  keep in mind, i wanted to pay for the item.  my husband cannot go back to construction junction today. . . most likely the item will be gone. . . it would have been nice had this  sales agent been more helpful - especially when it was clear how badly i wanted to buy the fixture.  she did not express any concern whatsoever for my requests:  (like, so sorry, i can't help you at the moment, please call back and i'll try to accomodate; give me a brief description and i'll try to find it... etc.).  sometimes, even if you can't accomodate someone, it's how you say it that makes all the difference.  construction junction will implode if it begins to treat its customers indifferently.",
          "I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out.",
          "I always see this place, and Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he loved. I however, ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. The pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. It was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning.",
          "Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.\\n\\nOur waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.\\n\\nHere's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \\n\\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\\n \\nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\\n\\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.",
          "Prepare to be wowed. \\n\\nHigh class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. \\\"Gar\\u00e7on\\\" I asked, \\\"may I try some of your french fried potatoes?\\\" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence.",
          "I agree with Paul on this one. But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. \\n(I think I feel my heart yelling at me again) , The gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet , I just might go back and ask her to marry me! \\nBut then again , she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online. \\nMaybe she just wanted my positive response. Ok Sarah B. you got it ... now where's my free coke ?",
          "Well, it started well. Food was okay. Deep dish pizza was good. But the salad we had - too tiny portion!!!\\nWe were greeted and seated well. But later the service was not all good. Bad bad service. First of all we had to ask for everything we wanted. The server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. She just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more).\\nLater when we talked about this in the front, the girl there also just listened and said \\\"okay\\\", not even a sorry once!!!\\nI would not like to go there again... :(",

          "We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \\\"yep\\\" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \\\"What do you want me to do\\\"?\\n\\nMy friend said \\\"An apology would be a good start\\\" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \\\"Get out and don't come back\\\" ???????? Are you kidding????\\n\\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \\n\\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\\n\\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service.",
          "I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\\n\\n20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \\\"definitely\\\" put our order in so it \\\"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\\\" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?\\n\\nThe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.\\n\\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.",
          "Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\\n\\n1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\\n3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \\\"Oh... I don't know\\\" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \\\"Let me check that for you\\\") he instead said \\\"Well, I'm going to hang up now.\\\"  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\\n4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \\\"I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\\\" to which she responded \\\"Yeah that should be fine\\\" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \\\"Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\\\" \\n10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\\n\\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \\\"Effing Men's Wearhouse.\\\"  For example, at a restaurant, \\\"Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!\\\"  \\\"Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.\\\"\\n\\nAnother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \\\"I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding\\\" to which I replied \\\"Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\\\"\\n\\nCongrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.\\n\\nTL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.",
          "You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know. \\n\\nI used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \\n\\nAfter having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....\\\"You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\\\". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \\\"bathroom break\\\", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach.",
          "This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian  spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again. \\n\\nI don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said \\\"dish looks beautiful.\\\" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  \\n\\nThe table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says \\\"I really enjoyed the steak you sent back.\\\" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!\\nAt this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said \\\"it's not my job to make people happy\\\" that's strange considering he wants our business. \\nSo the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.\\n\\nI couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.  Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  Sorry, we will never step foot in here again.",
          "Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. \\n\\nJust when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. \\n\\nSo if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!",
          "I ate here at around 8:00 on a Saturday night.  Reading the other reviews, it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant I was.  Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.\\n\\nWe were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  \\n\\nMy fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a \\\"baked potato pizza\\\" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.\\n\\nOverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.",
          "Very disappointing meal.  After waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.\\n\\n  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? \\n\\nTo make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.\\n\\nLong story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place!",
          "Well this visit started off good. I was seated right away, no wait. Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers. Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. \\n\\nNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.\\n\\nBottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are. Was just horrible.",
          "Had dinner at Papa J's with a group of 6.  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.\\n\\nPeople ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.\\n\\nWe ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.\\n\\nHard to tell if the deserts were \\\"homemade.\\\"  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. \\n\\nOn the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J's.  \\\"A-ok\\\" probably is the best way to describe it.",
          "A group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive. We where the only normal people in this place. The kids next to us who where only 14 where bragging and saying that they went to jail 2 times in their life. You had people selling their food outsdie the resturant. after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked. While we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it. Must I say more? bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for you.",
          "If you look at other reviews you will see that I am a very positive person, but tonight was an utter disaster!!  We sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable. We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did.  She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. We ordered appetizers and they never came out.  She actually brought us our check and we never got our food. By the way we were the only people at the bar.  Finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. We finally got seated by the windows. Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. Nothing was comped and no manager was available. This PF Changs needs new management!! We will never return. I will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. Steer clear until changes are made. It's not worth the headache.",
          "Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.\\n\\nWe walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\\n\\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\\n\\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \\n\\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\\n\\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.\\n\\nOverall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom...",
          "Fast food done right, what more can you want?\\n\\nA throwback to old timey diners, steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price. \\n\\nMy sisters and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour, which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise. This meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off! \\n\\nI ordered the western BBQ burger, which was 2 thin patties, cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, and fried onions. It came with shoe string fries (my favorite), all for the low price of $4.79. Are you kidding me? What's not to like! The food was actually pretty good! I liked it a lot. Since it was happy hour I also \\\"splurged\\\" on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. It was meh. Could have gone without it. The overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off, but the hot fudge saved it. But, how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?\\n\\nAll in all, 3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20. A steal. Also the food is good! I enjoyed it. I'd come back.",
          "I really enjoyed my Mongolian beef and pork pot stickers, but \\nThere was NO presentation of pfc mixing sauces. \\nOne of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill Non franchise is PRESENTATION and experience.  I was extremely disappointed by the LACK of presentation. \\n\\nReservations:\\nOur party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.\\n\\nAt 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . Obviously someone dropped the ball here.....\\n\\nWhen we requested silverware for the table. Our waitress blamed it on the hostess. Yes, theHostess should have provided silverware.. However It was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. As a Patron I could care less who's fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. Defiantly took away from my pfc experience.\\n\\nMy Hot and sour soup is usally served with\\\"noodley\\\" things that I drop in the soup. We weren't given any \\\"noodley \\\" things . Not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn't selling food as much as they are selling an experience. This experience is what sets this restaurant apart.",
          "While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today.  \\n\\nWhen my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. \\n\\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.\\n\\nin my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. \\n\\nI'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. \\n\\nFor me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!",
          "Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\\n\\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \\n\\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \\\"Are you working?\\\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\\n\\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \\n\\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \\n\\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \\n\\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.",
          "Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order.",
          "If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \\\"pies\\\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \\\"they were out\\\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.",
          "If you don't like your food... do not send it back to the kitchen... The \\\"Chef\\\" will come out and scream at you... Stay away from this place.",
          "We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. \\n\\nOne of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! \\n\\nSpoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \\n\\nWhen I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \\\"Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\\\" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!\\n\\nNot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. \\n\\nI am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!",
          "We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. My date was given vodka on the rocks. and I was given a Sam Adams.. \\nThey took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. We told them to bring another round and the check.  It was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.\\n\\nBy this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and I gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.\\n\\nfor 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka I was charged $31.03. I didn't have time to complain or ask. I won't be going back.",
          "My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. It was easy to find and no problems with parking. It's \\\"Seat Yourself\\\", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I'm guessing that this was Barb. She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. No big deal and her apology was appreciated. She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love, but come on now. We ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. The food was alright, really nothing special. A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. We may or may not go back.",
          "I've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  I also should have known that I shouldn't have cheated on my diet.\\n\\nI figured I'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  I opted for the Popcorn Chicken Salad.  Sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  Iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.  \\n\\nI have to say that even though I was saying yes, my body was saying, 'OH hell no!'\\n\\nI'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort.  Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now.  Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.\\n\\nI'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.",
          "The Pros: Great view of the city and river in good weather...  \\nLovely for loud large groups\\nVaried menu with some original items\\nGreat place to watch a game inside with a huge bar\\nFun location\\nGood place to take out of towners.\\n\\nThe Cons: The food when I went yesterday was not great.  We got the wrong sandwich, our order wasn't as described because the kitchen was out of \\\"lots of things\\\"  (Tell us when we order, not when you deliver the meal without elements on the plate.)  \\nCan be loud--not a place for a romantic date...\\nThe bathroom condition was really bad.\\n\\nThe server did comp up an appetizer, and they were friendly enough.. they just failed to wow. \\n\\nThe view was great, and we did enjoy walking around seeing the fountain dance to \\\"Pour some sugar on me\\\"  seriously?!?!?  Yes!   Classy eh?",
          "Meh, I've experienced better is an understatement.\\n\\nFriday's is like the \\\"fine dining chain\\\" for every yinzer in Pittsburgh...\\n\\n1.  When we were seated, it was quick which was a surprise.  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why.  I was happy about that.\\n2.  I ordered one of their \\\"skinny margaritas\\\", blackberry to be exact.  It was a nice size, however, at $6.00/pop, that was half of my food bill.\\n3.  The waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone.  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha!\\n4.  Food came.  My burger had lettuce on it only.  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  I had to wait to ask for my pickle.\\n5.  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting.  Disappointment.\\n6.  The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  \\n\\nNever again will I eat at Friday's.  I will, however, go should a happy hour arise...",
          "My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.\\n\\nThe food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\\n\\nThe service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\\n\\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\\n\\nThe prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\\n\\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's.",
          "They burned my fish and they burned it bad.  Ordering fish at Eat'n Park is always a gamble.  I just never know how it's going to turn out.  I'm a risk taker so I ordered two pieces of baked lemon sole. \\n\\nWell it went terribly wrong.  My waiter came out and said, \\\"They burned your fish, so I had them put two new pieces in the oven.\\\"  I was impressed by his honesty and didn't mind waiting for two new pieces.  \\n\\n I gladly helped myself to my boyfriend's french toast while I waited. \\n\\nThen out of no where another server comes to the table with the burnt fish and sets it down infront of me. With the burnt side down of course.  That just shows the kitchen is not in total coordination.  \\n\\nLike I said getting fish from Eatn' Park is a toss up. In the end I got two nicely baked pieces of sole to replace the burnt ones, so I left satisfied.",
          "Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back.",
          "This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. \\n\\nThe bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.\\n\\nIf not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.\\n\\nI think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...\\n\\n\\n\\nPS. The whole joint smells like major B.O.",
          "I have mixed feelings about this place. I wish I could give 2.5 stars, but I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up today. \\n\\nThis was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. \\n\\nWe were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were \\\"meant to be shared.\\\" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a \\\"here's your sauce\\\" kind of way. I remember thinking, \\\"That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce.\\\" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. \\n\\nForget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were \\\"meant to be shared\\\" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. \\n\\nOverall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. The music didn't fit the ambiance. Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. The restaurant was loud and crowded. The girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck-face puckered lip pictures...  \\n\\nI think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant, but no such luck.",
          "My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!",
          "Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \\\"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\\\". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!",
          "Walked in tonight, Wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  The phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. When she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  Didn't say a word to us. Unbelievable!  Will not be back there-- rude hostess!",
          "Disappointing. \\n\\nMy bf and I went for JUST dessert and wine, which we told the hostess ahead of time. The waitress was very curt and disrespectful. We were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was NOT closing time). She did not offer suggestions or advice.\\n\\nWe ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.\\n\\nThe waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it.",
          "Let me start by saying that I do like their food. \\n\\nLast night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was undercooked, and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.\\n(is that the way rice is prepared now?)\\n\\nI ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better.\\n\\n4 people, not crowded...2 hours total.",
          "A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \\n\\nThe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\\n\\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\\n\\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.",
          "Sandy had me holed up in Pittsburgh looking for a flight and staying with my wife's aunt. She adventurously agreed to go with me to a veggie place and that's how I ended up here. \\n\\nNice layout with tables along the windows and more in back. If you're not familiar with this kind of scene it could seem a little rundown, but to my eyes it was fine. Really, it's kind of the proto-typical East Coast college town vegetarian hangout.\\n\\nThe aunt-in-law is a meateater and in her seventies, but she really enjoyed her tempeh Cubano. And she loved her lavender lemonade. No room for dessert though.\\n\\nI got the Banh Mi and it was very tasty. 'Nuff said.\\n\\nThe service was in my mind delightful. The server was engaging and welcoming to my somewhat timorous companion, explaining the dishes to her and making a recommendation that worked out. He was efficient and personable.\\n\\nToo bad I won't be back in Pittsburgh anytime soon, or I would make a repeat visit for sure.",

          "Luigi's pizza is amazing! The sicilian pizza takes me back to how my grandma used to make homemade pizza. I can't wait to go back - definitely worth the 45-minute trip there :)",
          "A great little place. Delicious and affordable Italian food. Great salads and pasta. Try the pizza rolls!",
          "According to Urbanspoon (blasphemy I know) their are like 1,100 pizza places in pittsburgh. So what is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Everyone has an opinion and so here is mine: The best pizza in Pittsburgh is the pie comes from the place in you neighborhood that has quality ingredients, fair prices, and friendly service. Eddie's Pizza Place  is all of these things and since I live in this neighborhood this is my favorite.",
          "Underated and ignored!  if you see this ol time pizzaria near Kennywood stop on by good crust nice and buttery in the sicilian style!  Better then DiSallas  the only thing I can say that is better then Latinas is Mineo's !  they say the best pizzarias are the little holes in the wall type places and this is one of those enviroments!  Small and cozy very nice and relaxing afternoon!  To just enjoy with yourself and a friend!",
          "I've really enjoyed their pizza so far. I also ordered a chicken salad and it was tasty for a pizza take out place, nothing too fancy. I have only had the food at this place by delivery and it has always come before and hour has passed. The pizza always comes warm and ready to eat. Nothing to complain about. I did give it only 4 stars because there are a couple of other places that serve homemade ranch on the side which makes the pizza taste even extra delicious.",
          "I don't care what Cub and Bulls fans think, this Steeler and Penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. First, the crust tastes like a biscuit, and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. I will give UNOs a thumbs up on it's flatbread, it's better pizza than some pizzerias In the area. When I look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me, this place is a dud. Guess what? Chicagoans don't know how to eat hot dogs either!",
          "Good pizza and i love the breadsticks...i don't know too much else about this place",
          "this is the only place I order delivery pizza from.  they do a good job on their gourmet and specialty pizzas.  the bbq chicken is good.\\n\\nthe wings are average.  generally small and cheap with a seemingly storebought generic hot sause. nothing terribly special.  average\\n\\nthe hoagies are ok.  dont get a cold cut or italian style.  I'd stick with something like the hot sausage or chicken parm.  they tend to be better.  and they are huge.  like 16\\\" for a whole.\\n\\nthe calzones are massive and tasty as well.  go with heavy veg or a combination of meat and veg.  the breaks up the bread and cheese flavor.  well at least I've found them to be better anyway.\\n\\nthe pasta is expensive as heck and is average.  not a place to order pasta from unless its one of those lazy nights where you need that craving filled.\\n\\nsalads are typical.\\n\\nall in all not a bad place.  better than other pizza places in the area.",
          "Pizza is very hit or miss. When the owners are there, it's really good. When they aren't, you get pizza that is over cooked (more like burnt) and LONG delivery times. The pizza, even when plain, is very greasy. Way more than other places around. Usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese. Also they do not take credit or debit cards. There are better options.",
          "By far my favorite Pizza place in the east end.  The buffalo chicken pizza here is fantastic, and very unique.  I haven't been able to find anything even remotely approaches it in other cities.  \\n\\nThe place is a bit pricey, but I feel its worth it.  My go to pizza delivery place!",
          "Decent neighborhood pizza can be found in morningside at eddies pizza haus. The sauce and cheese are perfect, but the crust falls short.  It has a nice texture and overall the pizza isn't greasy, but the crust lacks much flavor. Maybe a little more salt is needed in the dough to compensate? The pizza is decent enough though and merits a try, perhaps it was an off day for Eddies.",
          "Pizza Parma delivers through GrubHub, which is the primary reason I ordered sandwiches from them. BBQ chicken was ok. The bread is a little more on the burnt than toasted side, leading it to be dry. The value is good. The 20\\\" sandwich was about $11.",
          "All in favor of a deep dish pizza say I!.......IIIIIII,  ok now that i have that out of my system. This place is such a great hangout/eat-in spot. I hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.\\n\\nWe arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches. \\n\\nAfter ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.\\n\\nI'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. \\n\\nWe came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come. \\n\\nOnly down side is slow service. It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked. He got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor!!",
          "I had the deep dish pizza and it was very good!  The individual size was smaller Than I expected for $12 but I wasn't starving so it was very filling.  Our waitress April was very nice and attentive for how busy it was.  We had about a 30 minute wait but it was worth it!  I can't wait to try it again!",
          "Horrible Food don't waste your money\\n\\nThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\\n\\nLoudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \\n\\nI looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.",
          "Yay, I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow, it was very good for us this visit.  Go to Papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the White Pizza.  It is the best white pizza I have ever had.  Order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic, spinach, feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  It was delicious!  Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.\\n\\nLike the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting.  \\n\\nThe bar was jumping thou never go to the bar.",
          "I was a bit disappointed with the pizza I got. I ordered the Milano special pizza, which had pepperoni, bacon, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc, and the popcorn chicken. The order itself arrived within thirty minutes which was great. Although the pizza tasted decent, the crust was not crispy at all, the slices were pretty floppy. They also skimped on the toppings a bit. I was hoping for a more loaded pizza. I'm not watching my weight--I can handle it. As far as the popcorn chicken goes, it was too salty, even with the honey Dijon dipping sauce. Probably not ordering from here again.",
          "Pizza Parma has many of the characteristics I like in a pizza joint. \\n1) They deliver when they say they will, \\n2) Diverse menu and toppings, \\n3) Coupons, \\n4) Online ordering, and \\n5) Take credit cards. \\n\\nI think Pizza Parma shines with their specialty pizzas. Artichoke, Buffalo Chicken, Spinach & Feta, and Greek pies are all delicious. I've also had some of their pasta dishes, and I can't complain. It's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. Pizza Parma fails on wings, though. The texture is unappealing (aka, flappy chicken skin-- yuk!), and the sauces lack depth. Desserts are also not worth the buy.",
          "All around delicious pizza, hoagie, apps place.  Always good. Consistent.  Can vouch for any pizza, Italian hoagie, jalape\\u00f1o poppers and fried mushrooms. All good.  Do yourself a favor and order perfecta.",
          "Some friends and I ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery from here tonight.  We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment, and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  My friend suggested getting pizza from here, and I didn't object, since I'd never had pizza from here before, and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.\\n\\nThe pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there.  As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).\\n\\nAs the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). It was better than Vocelli's, and about on par with Papa John's.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again, but I wouldn't object to it, either.",
          "I called for a delivery of a pepperoni pizza, large. Very simple since I was in the mood for it. The delivery and the time taken were exceptional. Very fast, very good delivery service. \\n\\nThe down side is the pizza. It was hot and fresh, but the flavor was just OK. It wasn't the best nor was it the worst. It was just OK.\\n\\nIf you do find that you like your pizza and need a quick delivery, you can't go wrong here. Other than that you may want to look elsewhere.",
          "For $10 you can get an 8 inch sub and a GIANT slice of pizza. Needless to say, this has become my favorite place to order dinner from.",
          "Papa J's is expensive and inconsistent.  The ambiance is nice but it doesn't justify the prices.  There are better restaurants in Carnegie.",
          "This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much, so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best I can come up with is as follows. Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... It's possible, although unlikely based on what I've seen.\\n\\nOn the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave.",
          "Three stars is super accurate for this place. We decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken BUBBA SHOW (does that plug raise anyone else's blood pressure??) Our order was ready in 15 minutes (speedy!) and we got a large 1 topping pizza for ~$8 and a side of fries. All together like $13 for three people, which is pretty good. As for the pizza, the crust was crispy and not too thick or thin, and the sauce was sweet, not seasoned. I prefer a more herby sauce myself, so I wasn't wowed by it. The fries were a bit soggy, but tasty. Overall, if I were in a pinch I'd order from here no problem but it's not a place I'd set out to order from because I love it.",
          "Great Hoagies! \\n\\nI always get the Steak Deluxe hoagie and my wife gets the Italian Deluxe and then we give each other half of the other ones hoagie because we can never decide on with one to get.",
          "I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. I went here around 12am on a Friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. I ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. The fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. There are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. \\n\\nThe people working there are really nice though which is a plus. Overall, i wouldn't go back.",
          "Worst pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered from here last weekend. The pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. The Buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily I had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. \\n\\nMaybe it was one bad night, and I can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, I can't recommend this place to anyone.",
          "Great pizza, reasonable prices, fast service - cant ask for much more!",
          "This is the greasiest pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh, I couldn't eat it.",
          "The food and customer service from this restaurant are really top notch.  I am continually impressed with how fast the delivery is and how likeable the drivers are.\\n\\nThe pizzas here are excellent as long as you don't get the \\\"crab meat\\\" topping (I should have expected gross imitation crab meat since we're so far from the coast).\\n\\nThe breadsticks, jalapeno poppers, and wings are also delicious.\\n\\nSome of the best pizza in Pennsylvania.",
          "What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\\n\\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\\n\\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \\n\\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \\n\\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \\n\\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \\n\\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\\n\\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!",
          "Okay so I just moved to the outskirts of Duquesne, PA which is outside of Pittsburgh from Harrisburg, PA of all places. Where I am at, really there is no delivery but these guys did. They were nice and cordial and cheap but I have been spoiled by the pizza shop in Harrisburg, Downtown, run my an old world Italian guy named Luigi. That pizza is/was MILES better than this. This crust, while thin, did not have flavor and was hard. The slices were small for their 8 slice which I did like. The cheese was good. The sauce was meh. I've definitely had way better. 2 stars for being cheap and delivering.",
          "I had heard lots of good things about Vento's. Unfortunately I did not get to experience these things. The service was slow and lukewarm. The pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. Also, no credit or debit cards here.  You're directed to the ATM in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   I ordered ahead and although I had to wait for my pizza when I got there I received it cold and it just was not that good.  I also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good.",
          "I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me \\\"Stay out of trouble\\\".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.  I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.",
          "I like the pizza and the selection of toppings.  They are reliable.  Great option for take out food.",
          "The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. For 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over $50 bucks. The personal pizzas alone were $11 each... If you want pizza and beer go somewhere else-pasta appetizers, or sandwiches... this place is good.",
          "I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\\n\\nFrench onion\\nChicken bites\\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\\n\\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. \\n\\nI really never want to return.",
          "I love N.Y. style pizza.  Could eat it every day.  On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.  \\n\\nOne thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.\\n\\nThe pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:\\nFiori's\\nPizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)\\nPizza Perfectta\\nAiello's (Murray Street)\\nBeto's\\n\\nSave for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.\\n\\nPizza Perfectta has a few stools and a counter but really it is a take-out place.",
          "Based on some recent reviews, it looks like the quality of food at Minutellos has slipped a little bit.  Still as I mentioned before, it's a Shadyside institution located in the basement of an apartment building.  \\n\\nAnyway, the main reason to come to Minutellos is for the pizza.  My cousin and I did just that the other night when we were in the area.  We did the whole 'Build Your Own Pizza' thing, ordering ours with pepperoni, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Good pizza even if the place is beginning to look a little dated.",
          "Yay, I'm a fan of the white pizza.  Had take out.  \\n\\nThe bar was jumping when I picked up our order.\\n\\nThe white pizza is so delicious...with garlic, spinach, feta, and added some veggies.  Tried the Roman Style calamari, very good better than the fried calamari we had last time.",
          "Good pizza and hoagies.  It is always busy.  Cash only.",
          "I had some pizza from Pizza Parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  A colleague brought it in, so I didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  I had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  Nothing special, nothing especially good or bad.  Crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin.  It was a little greasy, and quite cheesy as well.  I was starving so I really enjoyed it, but I think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  Still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, I'd say go for it.  Just don't have very high expectations.",
          "My friend and I have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. For a Thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. There were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. We ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken, hamburger and pepperoni (for him) while the other side had just pepperoni (for me). I was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory. I even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist, not dried out. This wasn't bad for a first visit so I will definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. I'm only giving Uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. Hello! The plate was yellow! How could she not have seen that?!",
          "We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not slices. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\\nIt also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again!",
          "This Valentines Day I ordered a pizza for my boyfriend and asked that they make a heart on it out of green peppers. The pizza was great, the heart was perfect, and he loved it!",
          "Home of the Italian Army.\\n\\nVento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.\\n\\nThey have tables and booths for seating. You can even play the PA lottery there. \\n\\nNo debit or credit cards. CASH ONLY!\\n\\n(F.Y.I. There is a generic ATM that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)",
          "In all fairness, I went to this place after stuffing myself at Vincent's Pizza Park.  Still, I know a good pizza when I see one, and this place is totally passable, but great or even good it is not.  My friend and I were given our pizza in a box although we were planning on eating on the premises.  Still, it seemed like we were not wanted and decided not to press the point.  We walked across the street to a parking lot and saw a Pizza Perfecttta box and some leftover pizza littered on the ground.  In the end we didn't finish our pizza and assumed that many people in the past have been hastily handed their pizza, pushed out the door, only to walk across the street, eat mediocre pizza, and decide it wasn't even worth the energy to pick it up and throw it away.",
          "This was one of first pizza places that I've tried inPittsburgh. It was about 5 years ago. I don't have a clear memory of that time but I have Parma pizza phobia ever since... So go figure...",
          "Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more, namely because I've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. Luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in a comfortable setting. It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.\\n\\nI've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. It's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.\\n\\nThe portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to Sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering Chef Boyardee either. The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. \\n\\nThe crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.\\n\\nI've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.\\n\\nAnd for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for. A place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense. \\n\\nAnd that is exactly what Luigi's is.",
          "Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\\\" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \\n\\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \\\"steak\\\" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \\n\\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!",
          "This is a Pittsburgh/Shadyside institution.\\n\\nWhat can I say, this place is good-eatin' basic Italian food!  Not spectacular, but when you want a good nuthin-fancy dinner, this is the place to go.  The pizza is outstanding.",
          "Pizza ok on it's own nothing great . Definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria UNO in Chicago. Are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark.",
          "Provolone sticks arrived undercooked, cheese was fully solid, they tasted okay. The pizza also arrived undercooked, the dough itself was partially uncooked in the middle. I had to put it back into my own oven to finish it off, and then it was greasy and just okay.",

I went back in and told him that the tow truck operator hooked it up to a jumper box and pumped the gas to start it. That's what he did. Then told me it probably didn't start because it was sitting so long. Then he told me \\\"I don't know anything about your car\\\"!

Upon arrival, store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts.  He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work.  I asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty.  I had heart surgery a while back and I can't do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incision/breastplate, if this was not the case with my health, I'd certainly take care of it.  Aftermarket rims are common - should not be an issue.  Last time I ever set foot in that place.",
          "I took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections.  First I was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall.  Secondly I was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off.   I was quoted $425 for them to get it off.  I was able to accomplish this with a $6 bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar.  \\n\\nWhen I returned to have the reinspection I was charged for it (their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within 30 days of initially failing free of charge).  This time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on.  This was odd as I had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass.  They once again quoted me $425, stating they would have to replace the wheel stud.  The new wheel stud cost me $3.50 at the local parts store and I did the job in under an hour without a single power tool.  \\n\\nThis shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs.  Avoid this shop.",
          "Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on.

They seem overpriced, too.",
          "I usually have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've dealt with Fran and others and have had very good experiences. However, this time was very different. I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, \\\"oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday\\\". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. \\n\\nI soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, \\\"oh, and we don't take checks\\\". \\n\\nThe next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, \\\"yes, of course\\\". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times.",

Thankfully I found all these reviews on Yelp about Walters and decided to give it a shot. \\n\\nRules about Walters: Plan at least two weeks ahead for an appointment. It is worth it. \\n\\nFrom there you don't have to worry about anything. On my particular car I always have to fix the suspension, and I ended up needing the same repair from last year. Last year I spent $1,300 from my very reasonable and trustworthy mechanic I had been using for years at home. This year Walters quoted me just under $700. I was pretty blown away by that considering the other place I go to is just as down to earth as Walter's.\\n\\nWalters took the time to put my tennis racquets in my trunk and remove my aftermarket stereo so they wouldn't be seen. He explained everything to me thoroughly and was really friendly when I came to pick up my car. \\n\\nI know a lot about cars and mechanics since I've worked at a dealership and the honesty of Walters still amazes me. I will take my car here every time I need to get something done, even if I get a newer car with a warranty from a dealership.",

          "Terrible. Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... I was originally told it would take 30 mins. Slow, over priced, I'll go elsewhere next time.",
          "I knew I needed new tires and an alignment so I ordered the tires ahead so I could be in-and-out as quickly as possible to make it to class. Showed up noone had ordered the tires but they said they'd split the difference of a different brand. I was a little irritated but agreed and thought this was going to be a bad decision coming here (I'm from out of town); however, I was pleasantly surprised by the service. The mechanics noticed the car's bushings were what was causing the problems it took awhile and they offered a little extra discount which was much appreciated. Overall, it took 2 and 1/2 hours, had front aligned, bushings replaced, two new tires, and an oil change....cost $606. So, I still believe it was a little pricey but the guys were great and I can definitely note an overall difference in my car.",
          "I've had a wide range of experiences here.  Let's just say, when I first moved here, one of the employees gave me poor advice and ended up totally screwing up my title.  It's been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed.  Another employee tried to help me fix it and screwed that up too.  Now I'm working with a third person who seems very competent and committed to helping me solve this problem, but even she is like \\\"I can't believe those other people told you to do that....they made this so much harder than it needed to be.\\\"  My thoughts exactly.\\n\\nWork with Barb, if you can.  She knows her stuff.  I don't quite trust anybody else to help me properly.  Also they're only open from 830-4 (or is it 430?) so you pretty much have to go before work, or on Saturday.  And I will be going in tomorrow at 830 until my car title saga finally comes to its conclusion....\\n\\nAlso, parking is free in their lot.

          "Bought a bike there on my second time in the shop.   Glen is very knowledgeable but can be a bit overwhelming, annoying and pushy, I can see how he can be very helpful to the average Joe, but if you are in his shop you should have done your homework, as this place is not walmart, mid to high level product here. I would encourage getting fitted and even buying a bike there, but going back for service is a whole different story.  Same day service is unheard of here, even for the simplest of adjustments, no service is available at all on the weekends.  the first time I took a bike there to have a rear derailer hanger replaced and re-adjusted (I had already purchased and had the hanger) 11 days went by before I returned to pick my bike up after not being called.  I figured it was just a fluke experience and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  The second time. I took a bike in to have a damaged shift lever replaced with a new 7800 pair. I called after 9 days and they said it wold be 2 days more.  when I showed up 2 days later it still wasn't done, it took 2 more following that, 13 days total.  Stay away from their service department",
          "Definitely overpriced for what they offered.

I found the cost of wheel hubs, they are no more than $150 each (for my car) and here they said that they cost $550 each (before labor). \\n\\nI also found out that the sensors get so soiled from all the dirt and salt that most of the time all the car needs is a simple wash on the undercarriage.

          "Have taken my car here a few times because there's a bus stop out front so it's convenient to drop my car off and get to work. But after what happened I will never be back. They just cost me money and lost my tires. \\n\\nIn March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. \\n\\nThis week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare! I called Monro early this morning to see if I could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest. I needed my car so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). \\n\\nI drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. \\n\\nAfter paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they \\\"would work with me\\\". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed? \\n\\nIf you need tires go to Pep Boys on Milvalle. If you need an oil change go to Midas on Penn Circle they'll be able to get you in and not wait three days.",
          "I had a great experience taking my vehicle to Mike's for repair after a fender bender. I used the Geico express service - I booked the estimate and repair online for the next day. When I dropped off my car, they were expecting me, it took less than 30 minutes and every single person I encountered at the shop was helpful and friendly and showed concern for me. The damage was minor, and the repairs took less than 48 hours to complete. My policy provides a rental car, and Enterprise was there when I checked in with my vehicle and the rental process was streamlined and easy. When I picked up my repaired car, it was just as efficient and friendly. Getting into an accident is frustrating and inconvenient and costly but Mike's Auto Body made the process of fixing things and getting me back on the road into a good experience. I wish more businesses treated their customers like Mike's treated me.",
          "Scenario: Get into my car at 3:30 and head to campus for a meeting. All of a sudden, the tire warning signal lights up even though I don't remember running over anything. I get out of the car to carefully inspect my tires and they feel/look completely OK. But after owning a BMW for 3 years and having constant wheel alignment/tire issues (ie. when a tire warning signal lights up, it usually means my tire's about to blow out!!), I freaked out and frantically drove my Infiniti to the first 3 auto shops on Baum Blvd. I waited at the first stop for 5-10 minutes and the guy did not get off the phone. I got back into the car and drove it over to Pep Boy's where a mechanic was outside smoking. He says I need to go through their service desk (inside their huge store) and deal with them first. I'm thinking, \\\"ugh. no time. I have class in 40 minutes and I'm already late to my meeting.\\\" I drive past the 3rd shop and I don't even see anyone sitting at the reception desk and figure it's going to take forever to get what I'm asking for.\\n\\nThen, I remembered the really positive experience I had with Walter's. I decided to drive to the end of Baum Blvd. to find his place and boy, am I glad I did. As soon as I got there, the service coordinator told me to pull my car around front so that their mechanic could take a look at my tires. He stopped what he was doing to do this and told me I could just stay in my car. Then, he reassured me that my tires were OK and he proceeded to inflate them, explaining to me why the signals might have come on.\\n\\nFree of charge, in and out within 5 minutes, and helpful/reassuring. I love this about Walter's Automative. They're not out just to make money. They genuinely just want to help. Highly reccommend!!",

          "I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.\\n\\nCoincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?\\n\\nWell, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  \\n\\nSo no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.\\n\\nFortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.  Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all.",

When told about this problem and that the mildew returned they said it was my fault for not turning the heat up and that damage done during service is an inherent risk the tenant is responsible for and nothing could be done. Their solution was for me to clean the mildew instead of properly insulating the unit to prevent mildew. \\n\\nThe entire building also has severe electrical problems that causes all lights to be replaced twice a month.

          "When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \\n\\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \\n\\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\\\"S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\\n\\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \\\"Should be ready in a few days\\\". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \\\"duke it over\\\" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?",

I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.

So, I could charge you $400 and you wouldn't know the difference?\\\" Joking or not, why even go there?",
          "I have an older car and so sometimes things go wonky. One night I had to drop it off because it was barely running and I had no idea why. This was the first time I went to Walter's, turns out that it was only an oil changing problem. Car places usually screw me over because I know nothing about cars, but Walters did not. They are really great and fix the car for your needs. Yesterday I returned for inspection and once again he treated me fairly and only mentioned things that I already knew needed work. I would recommend this place to anyone with an older car and wants an honest car repair man. Walter's will definitely be getting my business in the future!",
          "This place is looking to make money and rip you off.  The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection.  Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it, but this place said they would not pass it.  Weird how it passed inspection 3 times already with no other place mentioning the door being a problem.  Never giving this place any business again, I went to a different Meineke in Homestead where they are helpful and work with you.",
          "Great customer service.  I was in Pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport.  I found these guys on Yelp, and the reviews were not wrong.  It was easy to order the car and pick-up was prompt.",
          "Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.  Since they don\\\"t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours.  Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair,  They lost my business for good.",
          "Hands down a great experience! I called yesterday as the driver headlight on my car was out and asked if I needed to make an appointment. The woman on the phone said to just stop right by during their hours. I went by this morning and their (small) lot was full so I just sat in my car while I believe who was Tim was finished chatting with another guy. I continued to sat in my car for a couple of minutes while Tim quickly inspected my headlight. Unfortunately he did not have any replacement bulbs but ordered them right on the spot while I was there and told me to come back any time in the afternoon. Fast forward a few hours later. I  just popped by and after popping my hood and going into their office to pay, my headlight was replaced! Friendly, honest, fair and quick service. No BS. Highly recommend Walter's Automotive.",
          "I'm a lawyer in NY and I'm visiting a friend in Pittsburgh. I am blown away by the code violations in this unit. The tenants said they have reported these issues to the owner and to no avail. I am hoping to direct these tenants to a lawyer in PA.",
          "Great place. I take my car there for everything. Inexpensive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They've fixed my tire, taped a broken hose temporarily, and done other things for no charge several times. I'd definitely recommend them.",

          "Let me say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer ... it is SOOO good! The squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly that it was tender and delicious. Seriously, it was one of the best I've eaten, and I've made it a point of sampling calamari. The entrees (short rib ravioli and cavatelli) were very good, too. As for the Carrot Cob for dessert, forget it. It only detracts from the otherwise wonderful meal.",
          "OK, so I admit that I was underwhelmed by Cafe Zinho when I first went, a few years ago.  And then I didn't go for a long time.  A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am I glad we did!  It's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.\\n\\nI'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese.  That being said, it is mighty delicious.  I love the personal service.  I love the corn bread.  The starters are phenomenal, to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  But when we get them, they are lovely too.  I love the ambiance.  In short, I owe Cafe Zinho an apology.",
          "Another great big burrito restaurant, Casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.\\n\\nThe three dinning rooms, \\\"outside,\\\" inside and downstairs.  While downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  Perfect for a larger group of people.  Outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.\\n\\nThe food is Mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. The hummus here was actually the first hummus that I had ever had and I am sorry to say it is what I compare all other to, few match up.\\n\\nThe wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to Soba.  If you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, Casbah is it.",
          "My boyfriend took me to Casbah for my birthday this March. This is one of our twice-a-year splurges and I have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages.\\nWe were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same.\\nWe started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. \\nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day!\\nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \\\"fishy\\\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. \\nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.\\nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna!",
          "great atmosphere and great food. while the menu changes seasonally, my group all enjoyed the food - crab/scallop pasta, pumpkin risotto and rare tuna.\\n\\ncasbah also has a great wine list, and great service that is there when you need them, but doesn't annoy.",
          "I was underwhelmed with our dining experience. We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.\\n\\nMenu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy. \\n\\nI might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price I will dine on entrees elsewhere.",
          "Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.  I reaffirm my previous comments.\\n\\nGood service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.\\n\\nWhile the coffee is great, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.  The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good...  seriously, this meat is a fork cutting affair.  However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.\\n\\nAs with Eleven, you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix, so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door!",
          "Glad to see that the Big Burrito restaurants are alive and well in Pittsburgh, and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishments.\\n\\nBit of a complex review.  My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.\\n\\nWe sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.\\n\\nLots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following.",
          "CASH ONLY!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  The place seems to have some spacial issues.  There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol, more of a coffee/diner bar.  The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable, but maybe this is by design.  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.  Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not stop.  It was savory, spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night.    This is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to time.",
          "Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive!",
          "My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal. My mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and I to a Portuguese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went, looked at the menu and did not find anything Portuguese on the menu. Why does this restaurant promote itself as Portuguese, fly the Portuguese flag and not have ANY Portuguese dishes. We left.",
          "Casbah is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable. \\n\\nThe calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do! \\n\\nThe pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive. I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean plates at the end of the meal. \\n\\nI like the fact that it seems like the menu changes with the seasons. The proteins may stay static, but since they use a lot of local ingredients, the accompaniments/side dishes might be different every time you come. Honestly, this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. I plan on trying it for brunch or lunch sometime soon.",
          "I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday, for which we decided to use at Casbah a few weeks ago. It was my first time there, though I've tried a few other BB restaurants in the past. \\n\\nFood: \\n- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!\\n- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking\\n- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again\\n- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.\\n- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  \\ncaramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.\\n\\nService: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron. They were very accommodating in this way. \\n\\nWill I go back? Someday - but I think I may try Soba or Kaya first.",
          "Meh.  Seriously?  Mediterranean?  What?  Sorry, but just because you serve scallops on babah ganoush doesn't make your restaurant Mediterranean.\\n\\nThis was kind of a disappointment, if you couldn't tell by my sarcastic tone.  The food was good, and I had a great time, but the food lacked the final eyebrow raising component that you come to expect with the bill that follows.\\n\\nThat said, the wine list was good and the prices were reasonable relative to the food.  Get the cheese course for dessert and you'll go home happy.",
          "Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!\\n\\nOur meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).\\n\\nMy two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.\\n\\nAfter our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with \\\"Happy birthday\\\" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.\\n\\nWe visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.\\n\\nIn sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!",
          "Amazing brunch! I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.\\n\\nFor $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. \\n\\nI started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\\n\\nI tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. \\n\\nAlso, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.\\n\\nFor brunch in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. Not to be missed!\\n\\nNow I just need to make plans to go back for dinner.",
          "Sharia don't like it, and neither does Becky. \\n\\nBoy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. \\n\\nWe shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. \\n\\nMany yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. \\n\\nI had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. \\n\\nI ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. \\n\\nWe glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead. \\n\\nOverall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag.",
          "I was treated to Casbah for lunch by a potential employer who had passed me over, but really, really liked me. She said it was her favorite restaurant, but that she didn't go as often as she'd like.\\n\\nI knew the building from the early 80's when it had been one of Pittsburgh's dive gay bars called 'The Tender Trap', and knowing this, as well as a lot about the Big Bistroid Group...oops...Big BURRITO Group, I was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual Big Burrito hype.  And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.\\n\\nThe service was good. Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.\\n\\nThe menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings.  My friend had a salmon salad, and I opted to try the Farm Lamb Mac-n-Cheese.  The waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread.  For a beverage, we both opted for just water.\\n\\nI have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed.  \\n\\nFor LUNCH, the prices were all around the $15 range, and the portions were NOT large.  The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.\\n\\nI can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.\\n\\nThe Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.\\n\\nBasically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.\\n\\nSeriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!\\n\\nI also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.\\n\\nI can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.  \\n\\nI'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion. \\n\\nWho are all of these easily dupe-able rich people, and where do they come from? Want to blow that kind of money? Get out your check book and let me give you my address!",
          "The adjectives that come to mind when I think of Cafe Zinho are cute, quaint, cozy and in a random area. I don't think I would have stumbled upon this place just upon chance. I made a reservation for three on a Tuesday night at 7. My two friends were already there and then... there was just me in the restaurant, which scared me a little bit but I have to have faith in my fellow Yelpers. \\n\\nThe waitress was an adorable woman who was so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about the dishes in a quiet manner. You just wanted to pinch her cheeks or something. Anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet, unlike many of the other restaurants breads that I have had, which I enjoyed. We ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey deliciousness and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that night which had capers, a potato, rice and some roasted vegetables. Great light combination and not too heavy. The size of the sea bass was like of the entire whole fish. To top it off we had the rice pudding dessert which was similar to flan but I thought this was so tasty. I kind of want one right now as I am typing this review.\\n\\n\\nI am so glad I went to Cafe Zinho finally and would happily come back here again.",
          "I finally went to Casbah for brunch today. Rolled in at 10am to meet a handful of people. Because it is Labor Day weekend, the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy. We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree. Portions were large, atmosphere was cool, food was good and wait staff were awesome but in the end I don't think $24 (not including the tip and tax) was worth it.",
          "Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. Everything looked great on the menu, but execution was flawed through out our meal. Also, their dishes are not really Portuguese.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.\\n\\nEntrees were, on the whole, not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked). The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor. The lamb burger was also overcooked.",
          "Top points. \\nService. I was there with a large group for a meeting. They gave us a private room and two servers took care of us. They were efficient and very accommodating. Kudos. \\n\\nAppetizers: had the crab dip and calamari. Both were good. Servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed. I'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. Dip was good. Calamari was done well. Preferred the shrimp cocktail Sauce with it versus the Asian type soy sauce that is served with it. \\n\\nWedge salad with bleu cheese. Waaaaaay too much cheese and I like bleu cheese. \\n\\nI had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! Green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. Simple green beans would have been more appetizing. \\nTuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. Was not over cooked. Potatoes as expected. \\nOther dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. Would be nice if this was offered broiled as well. Crab cakes and filet looked okay. \\n\\nOverall I'm always underwhelmed and overcharged here. I guess with chain places you get that, but I want more from a place that charges me 25 bucks for sub-seared tuna.",
          "This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. \\n\\nGotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. \\n\\nWhat I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a \\\"Mediterranean\\\" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. \\n\\nI do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!\\n\\nSo pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!",
          "The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a \\\"foodie\\\" palate, don't even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it.",
          "Brunch = best in the burgh.  Hands down.  Best. eggs. ever. I am not even sure how the eggs can be that good.  I know what you are saying, \\\"They are eggs, Jessica.  Get a grip.\\\"  No.  I will not.  I cannot.  I want to stand on top of rooftops and shout my love for these eggs all over town.  \\n\\nJ, H and I went there a few Sundays ago.  We all got the same thing. When was the last time you went to a meal and all three people ordered the same thing.  It was that good.  The scallop breakfast is out of this world.  2 perfectly cooked scallops, scrambled eggs (the eggs!!!), the creamiest, tastiest grits in the world, buttery croissant and sausage, apples and butternut squash.  Don't think those things go together?  They do and are awesome!  J and I also both got orders of bacon cause no brunch is complete without bacon.  \\n\\nOur service was also great.  Nice hostess, awesome waiter.  All was perfect.  \\n\\nReally freaking good brunch.  Really.  Cannot say enough about those freaking eggs.  \\n\\nOh, but don't order an additional mimosa from the deal - they are $8 a piece which is a bit steep.",
          "My husband and I went to Casbah to celebrate my birthday one evening.  We were seated on the patio which was fine before a party of 20 was seated with a 1 year old who was banging his silverware on the table all night.  So much for romantic!  Ever hear of a babysitter?  Anyway, ambience aside, let's get to the food which overall I would give a C+.  We started with the veal and pork meatballs which were the highlight of the meal.  The perfect blend of sweet (fresh tomato sauce) and spicy -- the meatballs had a nice tang, and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasn't much of it there.  We each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless.  I grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. These tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in December.  Very disappointing.  I opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu.  It was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.  Another disappointment.  My husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food.  All this said, the service was professional, we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and I their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine.  I might return here for happy hour but it was not the right choice for a romantic special occasion dinner.  And we had the decency to hire a babysitter for our children, otherwise we would have stayed home.",
          "The interior is very nice. The food is a hit or miss. We went for brunch today. You can select a drink (alcoholic or non), an appetizer, and a brunch entree for the price of $22. The appetizers we had (pollenta and squash&chestnut soup) were very good. The entrees, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. We got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet. The omelet was very bland. It did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. Basically, I have had better omelets at some Denny's. My drink mimosa was just OK. My girlfriend's blood mary was delicious, though -- uniquely spicy. \\n\\nI have been to Casbah 4 times, last time being for brunch today. The first time, it was good, worthy of 4 stars. It gradually went down to 3 stars. The wine selection is good. But the food is definitely hit or miss. Once I had a halibut that smelled like the ocean. It was not well cooked or fresh, or something. Consistency is the key in a nice restaurant; Casbah leaves much to be desired in this regard.",
          "I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New Year's Eve 2012... What a terrible judgment call that was on my part. So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  I still regularly dream of this restaurant. Do I dare say it's my favorite restaurant? I'm not sure, but if it's not my favorite, it's certainly close.\\n\\nWe returned after NYE last year to celebrate my birthday in March, making sure to bring along the oh-so-coveted Big Burrito birthday coupon. I ordered the Orecchiette with Chicken, Cranberries, Goat Cheese & Sage Cream. Oh. My. Goodness. Don't order this if you're on a diet... but order this if you love delicious food and living life to the fullest. It was ridiculously creamy, and the cranberries packed the perfect fruity balance to the rich dish. My husband ordered the Double-Cut Pork Chop with Kale & Butternut Squash Risotto. While recently dining at a highly rated restaurant in NYC, he said, \\\"My double-cut pork chop at Casbah was better than this double-cut pork chop.\\\" That's when I knew that I needed to update my review of Casbah.\\n\\nFinally, my delicious birthday dinner ended with the Dark Chocolate-Raspberry Bread Pudding. I love ordering bread pudding at restaurants, and I think this is the best of them all. I would confidently enter this dessert in a bread pudding competition, knowing that I would be walking away with the blue ribbon.",
          "Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm.  It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. \\n\\nI immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. \\n\\nI started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was ok. \\n\\nFor the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.\\n\\nFor the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.\\n\\nThe cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. \\n\\nLastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. \\n\\nService was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent. \\n\\nThis place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn't go back for that price.",
          "Casbah continues to be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. High quality service and creative dishes. Sign up for mailers for Big Burrito special offers and birthday discount.  \\n\\nMust try:\\nCalamari\\nCheese plate\\nShort Rib Ravioli\\nPork Chop\\nWatermelon Gin Fizz",
          "My wife and I go to Casbah every year for my birthday. It is my favorite of the Big  Burrito restaurants, and they have a birthday deal for $30 off an entree. \\n\\nThis time I started with the Parsnip & Chestnut Soup, garnished with braised chicken, arugula & almond pesto. It was divine, with the rich sweetness for which parsnips are noted. My main course was Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with flageolet beans, merguez sausage, turnips, greens and whole grain mustard. It was cooked perfectly pink, as ordered, and the flavors complemented each other.\\n\\nFor dessert, I skipped my usual chocolate - they offered Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Cheesecake and Dark Chocolate Raspberry Bread Pudding. I decided to try the Pumpkin Bread with Butter Rum Sauce and Cream Cheese Ice Cream.  The cake was light and tasty and the ice cream and sauce were excellent.",
          "I took my boyfriend to Casbah at the end of September for his birthday. We were seated near the door for our reservation however it was a very warm night so it was nice to sit in an open air setting. Our server, her name has slipped my mind, was excellent. I am not a fan of red wines but my boyfriend is and it being his birthday, of course I said let's get a bottle of red. We explained to our server what white varietals I enjoy and she suggested a bottle (which has also slipped my mind being months ago that we were there)that was perfect-both of us enjoyed it. We started off with the papardelle. The rabbit was delicious and it was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked-the flavors were amazing together! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the duck and I ordered the short rib ravioli. His words to describe the duck were \\\"life changing\\\". I was only able to taste a small piece of his since he ate it so quickly, but I agree it was excellent. The short rib was so tender and juicy. I was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not. It was the best ravioli I have eaten hands down! For dessert, we ordered a cheese tasting. It was the perfect way to end our meal-with the cheese tasting and a glass of wine. I can't wait to go back to Casbah and sample some other items-I would have ordered the entire menu on our first visit if I could have!",
          "I have a soft spot for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me to, and he made a special night out of it. We've been back many times, for many occasions, and Casbah has never disappointed. Great wine, cocktails, food, service, and atmosphere. It can be a little more cramped on the inside, but it's never too loud. If you can sit outside, it feels nice and spacious. It's also very nice downstairs.\\n\\nThe valet parking is a huge plus in my book, especially in that area of Shadyside. The service is always prompt and never overbearing. \\n\\nThe last time we went, we had the sheep's milk gnudi and I'm pretty sure it was sent straight from heaven down on to our plate. I nearly fought my fiance for the last piece. He loves me so he let me have it. The swordfish was wonderful. The lamb is always great. The short rib ravioli melts in your mouth. I'd highly recommend any of those.\\n\\nThe dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding is worth unbuttoning your pants for...and if you like dessert wines, you'll be in heaven for sure!",
          "I have to agree with the \\\"hit or miss\\\" reviewers about Casbah, at least when it comes to the food. I came here for brunch last weekend with a big group. They were very accomodating to us throughout the reservation process and the brunch, which was good. And our waiter, Daniel, was great. \\n\\nThe previous reviewer who said the Bloody Mary is the best drink was spot-on. It had a great spice and was the only drink that seemed like it had any alcohol in it at all. The mimosa and sangria were very \\\"eh.\\\" \\n\\nI loved my smoked salmon appetizer (and that did seem to be the hit at the table), but entrees around the table left people disappointed. The goat cheese and mushroom omelette could have had a heckuva lot more goat cheese and mushrooms, and my scallop/sausage/grits/egg dish just had way too much going on. The grits were actually fabulous, but the scallops were overcooked and got lost next to the scrambled eggs (?) and sage sausage crumbles. \\n\\nIf I lived in Pittsburgh, I could see myself coming back here for wine and appetizers, but I'm not sure I would make it a regular brunch or dinner spot.",
          "This update is for Casbah's brunch.\\n\\nAlright, Casbah. You got me, you got me good. Dinner as I mentioned before was decent, but the brunch, amazing. Compared to dinner, brunch at Casbah is definitely the better meal and deal. I don't advocate playing favorites when it comes to siblings in the same family, but sometimes you can't help it. Brother Brunch gets the nod here.\\n\\nBrunch is basically a fixed set. For $28, you choose an adult beverage (or non-alcoholic), an appetizer, and an entree. They start you off with some pistachio scones, buttermilk biscuits, and cornbread. Perfect, I like to stretch before I get my grub on. For my Prix-Fixe (fixed set), I went with the mimosa, smoked salmon, and sea scallop fry. \\n\\nSMOKED SALMON: If you like smoked salmon, then you would enjoy this appetizer. It's what you would expect but also a larger size than I thought it would be! \\\"Oh no, there's too much of something I like,\\\" said nobody ever. Upon seeing the smoked salmon display fanned out on its plate with bits of egg, red onion, and aioli garnished over top, my salivary glands couldn't control themselves! \\n\\nSEA SCALLOP FRY: You know I love me some scallops. The dish came with two scallops, a small croissant, small bits of fennel sausage, a side of white corn grits, and a little bit of butternut squash and caramelized onions. I was tempted to go with the classic eggs/toast/waffle as an entree, but I am so glad I put on my big boy foodie stretchy pants and took a chance. It's not your typical brunch dish and it's one I would definitely recommend. \\n\\nAll in all, fantastic brunch experience. Definitely felt comfortably full, but not in a self-hatred, \\\"I-regret-this-decision-immediately\\\" kind of way. Service was professional; our waitress kept the waters filled and came in to check on us a little after each dish was served.",
          "As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded ... the place is nice, fancy, organic-ish, alternating menu, nice atmosphere. Good date restaurant. Good food-lovers restaurant.",
          "Very disappointed in the customer service. We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. We will not be back . The iced tea is also terrible tasting.",
          "casbah is the last big burrito restaurant i had left to try and i really liked it. i started with the sangria to drink which was delicious, and i'm usually not a huge fan of sweet drinks like that. we split the grilled flatbread app. the dips weren't anything super special, but the bread was thick and flavorful. no complaints. then we both got piccola gusta and split all our items. (the piccola gusta gives you salad or soup, half a sandwich, and half a pasta) between the two of us we had the tomato & basil bisque, arugula salad, crab cake sandwich, salumi sandwich, orecchiette pasta, and ricotta cavatelli.\\ni'm not a big fan of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great as well. the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... probably my favorite part of the meal. both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.\\ni love the atmosphere, we sat out on the covered patio, and the service was great as well.\\ni'll definitely be back again, hopefully to try the different brunch and dinner menus!",
          "I'm actually giving it 3.5 stars.  3 for the appetizers and 4 for the entrees.  My wife and I went to Casbah for the first time.  As we usually do, we decided to share our entrees (TIP - you can get half portion sizes of the pastas!!) and augment the meal with a few appetizers.  For the appetizers, we got the chickpea flatbread, the arugula salad and the sea scallops.  The flatbread and salad were just OK.  The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the \\\"cured egg yolk\\\" which was infused in the avacado sauce.  For those who have never tried a cured egg yolk, I would consider yourself lucky.  Actually, the taste wasn't too bad.  The smell, however, reminded me of what you would smell if you were on the set of a nasty version of a Hoarders TV episode.  Must be an acquired taste.\\n\\nFor the main course, we chose the short rib ravioli and the cavatelli.  Both were excellent, especially the ravioli.  No complaints at all.\\n\\nOverall, a very pleasant experience.  Good atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly.  The place was busy and had a nice vibe to it.  Unfortunately, some of the food was a slight disappointment.",
          "Love Casbah.  Been going there for years and have never had a less than great meal and service.  OF course their signature lamb is to die for (with the Stag's Leap Petite Syrah).  What can I say -- the cheese plate is great.  Everything is well-prepared and the service is among the best in the -burgh.",

          "As a Brooklyn based live indie-electronic/hiphop performer that travels, Shadow Lounge is by far one of my all time favorites.  As a Pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys, graff heads, MC's and DJ's doing their local thing, it's amazing to see this place has become so professional, original, and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of Pittsburgh.  The service is delightful on both sides (AVA/Shadow Lounge), the prices are just right, the sound system is a complete BANGER with crisp and clean sound.   The crowd is mad cool and always responsive to good music.  Shadow Lounge really holds it down for Pittsburgh's scenes no matter the genre.  Can't visit Pittsburgh without stopping by Shadow Lounge.",
          "Absolutely amazing! Great staff and service! Best music in Pittsburgh, hands down.  Good work guys!",
          "Not quite authentic but good enough for Pittsburgh. It's the only place that I've found that even comes close to a classic Chicago style deep dish.\\nI also had the french onion soup that wasn't bad. The croutons were still crunchy and it had just the right amount of cheese.\\n\\nMy girlfriend really enjoyed her Caesar salad and said she'd come back just for the salad.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed it and would come back the next time I get a craving for a deep dish pizza. It wasn't authentic but it certainly was not terrible.",
          "When Hotlick's died, Buffalo blues was born. It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....\\n\\nFood is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! \\n\\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your \\\"space\\\" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called \\\"party room\\\" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\\n\\nWant to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!\\n\\nThe \\\"wonderful\\\" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, \\\"Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!\\\" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).\\n\\nThe food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!\\n\\nThis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!!",
          "If you want a true understanding of Pittsburgh in the morning, come here. This greasy spoon is always packed, and is one of the better of its kind south of the city.\\n\\nThey serve waffles in halves, which is great. The eggs and toast are good, the homemade hot sausage is excellent. The drawback are the barely cooked potatoes.\\n\\nIf you're hungry, get \\\"The Mixed Grill\\\"... Gab and Eat's brand of the \\\"kitchen sink\\\" breakfast that all Midwest places are about.",
          "I'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. I've only gone to Duke's one time, but the food was good. It wasn't too busy so our service was very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food at all.\\n\\nThe place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area. We sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full. The dining room area definitely fills up with an older, have lived in Pittsburgh all their lives crowd, while the younger crowd is in the bar area. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back since I live in the area.",
          "Wondering where the Pittsburgh hipster crowd hangs out? Look no further than the fixie parked outside the Quiet Storm. \\n\\nAnd then go inside and have some delicious food and drink.",
          "Though I didn't get a chance to visit this place when I visited last month, I really do love Quiet Storm and I will be sure I hit it up next time I'm in town visiting my friends there. The decor is adorable. The prices are reasonable. It was an intimate place to see a show and it's too bad they are no longer doing them here. I really feel like this place was one of the first things that made me heart Pittsburgh. It's truly a unique space.",
          "Ok this is my first yelp review, I never left any reviews for other restaurants, but I am writing it because I want others to know about this place more.\\n\\nRestaurant run by family. very friendly, clean cooking environment, and Great food. I would come to this place again and again whenever I visit Pittsburgh.\\n\\nIts less than 10min drive from Kennywood, if you are visiting Kennywood you should definitely try this place.",
          "Service is a little slow but overall the best food I've had in Pittsburgh so far. If you're a seafood fan, the scallops are amazing. Very decent wine list and lots of parking.",
          "This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \\\"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\\\" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.",
          "The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\\n\\nThe setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\\n\\nIt's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\\n\\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\\n\\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\\n\\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.\\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \\\"Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\\\"  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.\\n4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask \\\"would you like a refill on that?\\\" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \\\"would you like another one?\\\" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \\\"we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.\\\"  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.",
          "Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!",
          "This might be the best food I've had in Pittsburgh.\\n\\nThe restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand. The hostess stand is located in the indoor space. We were seated in the outdoor section in a corner which was fairly drafty. This is the only negative point I have about the meal.\\n\\nWe ordered the cheese  tasting menu, the duck, the scallop pasta, and the lemon sponge cake. Each bite was perfect -- flavorful and expertly cooked. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable. We left feeling full and happy.",
          "I miss this place. When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh, I remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did.",
          "Named for Pittsburgh greats, Gene Kelly and Billy Strayhorn, this historic theater is a real gem.  Originally the Regent, built in 1914, the building was renovated in 2000 as a performing arts center for theater, dance, music and film.  I have been to several fundraisers hosted by the Kelly Strayhorn, and they have always been first rate.  Also, I recently attended the Kelly Strayhorn's own fundraiser, Full Bloom, which was lots of fun.  As a venue, this place is definitely worth your attention, and the staff seems to bend over backward to make sure events go off without a hitch.",
          "OK, what is with all of these \\\"CASH ONLY\\\" places in Pittsburgh? I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. \\n\\nLooking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!\\n\\nMy first impression is \\\"Eh.\\\"  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast! Seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:  \\n\\n\\\"2 eggs and toast $x.xx\\\"\\n\\\"2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx\\\"\\n\\\"2 eggs and pancake $x.xx\\\"\\n\\nI'd rather go to a Denny's and order the \\\"create your own Grand Slam!\\\"",
          "There is a disconnect here between this name, the decor and the food. That said, I had the best pork chop I've ever had here and for that I was endlessly thankful. Good salad, delicious bread and hummus. Great service. For Pittsburgh, top notch.",
          "The home-cooked breakfasts at The Rusty Nail in Bellevue are wonderful, prices are reasonable, the wait staff are gems, and is often bragged about by Bellevue locals.  That said, two stars is all I can muster primarily due to the tiny, cramped dining area.  I've witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I adore that Pittsburgh is a small, friendly city, but I'm not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs, nor knowing his guest gargled with Cool Mint Listerine this morning (or worse, didn't) .  Yes, the tables are packed THAT close together.  And whatever you do, don't dare bring a large friend here to dine when it's busy unless you enjoy feeling like a complete 'jag off' for doing so on the way out.",

          "My favorite for Pt. Breeze/Pittsburgh East End. Flat New York style, not greasy, timely delivery, they know my orders!",
          "The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The K\\u00f6lsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience.",
          "Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? Oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh.",
          "I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. \\n\\nThis place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\\\"  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.\\n\\nWe want to return sometime for \\\"turkey day.\\\"  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!\\n\\nCan't wait to return.",
          "The front serves as a good Pittsburgh sports bar. It's a particularly great place to watch the Penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. There are lots of HDTV's and there is a good selection of beer. \\n\\nThe food, however, is bland and is terrible bbq, even for the northeast. I would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home.",
          "The food here is pretty good.  Comparable to any 3 to 3.5 star restaurant.  The lamb is definitely good.  And it is definitely a good date restaurant.  I would rather give it 3.5 stars since I've definitely eaten at better restaurants. But for Pittsburgh, it ranks pretty high up.",
          "Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. \\n\\nIt's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. \\n\\nTuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.\\n\\nI'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.",
          "I really love this little place. The hot bar is almost always completely wonderful. I especially love the breakfast/brunch on weekends, it's one of my favorite meals. The potatoes and garbanzo bean patties are amazing.\\n\\nThe prices are pretty much in line with any smaller heath and local food oriented grocer. I can usually count on them to have specific items that Whole Foods is sold out of and sometimes at a better price. Plus, the Co-op hot bar is a million times better than the Whole Foods hot bar - quality over quantity all the way.\\n\\nShort lines, great staff, good for Pittsburgh.",
          "Very good cheap food. Pittsburgh classic.Great desserts! The oreo pie is amazing! The servers are always very friendly. The salad bar could be a little more clean.",
          "This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.\\n\\nIts been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \\n\\nThe food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.\\n\\n-Fish Sandwiich\\n-Salmon (huge and delicious)\\n-Flounder\\n-Shrimp a few ways (\\\"Norfolk\\\" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)\\n-Hawkins St Special\\n-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)\\n\\nThe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.",
          "Though Casbah has been around for ages this was our first time dining there. In short, the restaurant itself was nice and the food interesting though a little on the pricey side. Service started out great but for some reason our entrees took forever and our waiter more or less abandoned us. If I'm spending a $150 on dinner for 2 I expect some sort of explanation on why we are having to wait 45 minutes plus between our appetizer and the entrees. At a minimum, I don't want to have to flag down the server to order another drink and for god's sake don't make me ask for a refill of my water.  If I was only basing my decision on food I'd probably go back but all things considered there are too many other restaurants in Pittsburgh where I can get amazing food AND an amazing dining experience.",
          "In the Homestead area of Pittsburgh. Seafood gumbo was very good.\\nBroiled scallops were very good, partner had sea bass stuffed with lobster, also very good. Vegetable sides were not as good as the fish. With two glasses of wine the total was $83. In and out in an hour.\\nI'd go back because the fish was that good",
          "Don Don is a restaurant I find myself missing now and again, it's probably my favorite restaurant in Carnegie. Simple setup, just a small restaurant with a few tables and a TV. Oddly enough I think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup, never had better. The food is average but I always enjoyed eating there, great service and a cheap place to get Chinese food.",
          "One of the most eclectic venues in Pittsburgh. Shadow Lounge has a great variety of acts that it pulls in.\\n\\nI just went to their Titletown Soul & Funk Party and it was a really great time. Great music, fun crowd, pretty decent prices on drinks. I'll definitely be going back for Titletown and in general, Shadow Lounge is a great place to see alternative acts in Pittsburgh.",
          "1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!\\n2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta, not sure what.\\n3. Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!!\\n Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly!",
          "A great Pittsburgh diner with friendly service and good diner food. If there are any problems, the prices a bit high for diner food and, as others have said, it's extremely cramped. Otherwise, it's an enjoyable place to eat and the food is, indeed, very good.",
          "I like this place; it single-handedly made me hate Pittsburgh just a little less.  In fact, this would be an easy 5 stars if it wasn't in Pittsburgh and therefore emblazoned with all manner of Steelers propaganda, and as a Browns fan I...I just can't do it.  I'm sorry.  The sandwiches were good and prepared with genuine care and attention to detail, the people were friendly and the prices reasonable.  Get the soft pretzels, toss 'em in the microwave and eat them with mustard.",
          "came back to Pittsburgh for a wedding and couldn't find anything in my price range close to the city until i found this motel...it was very affordable....room was okay...cable tv and a/c worked fine....",

It started well enough when we ordered lunch, but ended horribly when my daughter said we should get a treat for my husband. \\n\\nBetween being ignored by the girl at the counter, her not listening to the order, then arguing with me when I told her I did not ask for what she brought me, I really can't decide which is worse.

Most of the staff are pretty friendly and sweet but there are a few sour ones in the bunch that make the experience not as nice as it could be. Although they still technically do their job, you can FEEL very negative vibes from them and see how inefficient they are with the way they do things. It's a hit and miss. Unless you know one of the servers and their schedules. The low rating is mainly for the slow service and the handful of staff members who aren't very pleasant.",

Each time hoping that the last was just a fluke, new staff, or something.  It's not.  Doesn't matter what time we go.  It seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes, and then the service is mediocre at best.  Occasionally, we've had a stellar service, but it's few and far between.  Today, after waiting 15 minutes, then getting up to find a server in another section, we were informed that we were sitting in a \\\"closed\\\" section.  That server offered to serve us, but honestly, we left.  I told the hostess who seated us about the mixup, and got a blank stare.  I've never had this issue at any other EnP.  We left, drove to the Squirrel Hill location, and our orders were taken in the amount of time we wasted at the Waterfront.  Mgmt- you have a beautiful, prime location.

I think one server was high. \\n  \\n  Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging.",

          "I've had bad experiences here a few times now.  I wrote panera bread and haven't heard back.  Bad service all around!!!  Basically, we ordered our food, they ran out of what we wanted, so just decided to make us something else with out telling us.  When we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back.  Really, you don't get much for what you pay for at panera.  Its not very good at all.",
          "I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order, and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. And I have to be clear it was a Saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables with people at them and I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant, especially since burgatory just opened across the street.",
          "Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated, never again!",
          "Food is Shitty probably would be good if they had a cook that knew how to cook it correctly.  Staff is ok no complaints drinks are good as well",
          "I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat.",
          "Food phenomenal! Service can be hit or miss.",
          "My husband and I stopped going here, back in 2010, because of the bad service we were receiving. We used to call the servers \\\"Whole Foods Rejects\\\"; they were always cranky and we felt not welcomed, rushed. At the end of 2011, I think they got a new manager, the service has been optimal and we haven't stopped going since. Their food is delicious as well as their drinks and coffee.",
          "Everytime I eat at this location I end up with a sick stomach.  I don't have that problem at other Arby's.  The dining area is clean and everything else seems ok but I always get a sick stomach.  Maybe they should relook at their food prep.",

          "Dined in twice, food ok, atmosphere good.",
          "Service was great. Apps delish, specifically the stuffed banana peppers & lentil with ham soup. I think I chose the wrong entree though because I ordered a cod with crabmeat special. The cod was completely tasteless with some crabmeat layed across the top. It all reminded me of boiled fish. Yuck! Note to self. Order the pasta!",
          "Great stuff here...The cheese plates are great and always changing. Awesome staff, and the menu offers an nice variety!!\\n\\nAsk for Tim for your waiter!",
          "Good for Altar bar. But they didn't have fries....",
          "Oh I love this place.  It has a great menu and wine list.  It has all the great dishes with a touch of flare.  I took this meal to seafood town from start to finish and have no regrets.  The staff was really friendly - realized I was there for a special occasion and brought out a desert that said congratulations - the little things.\\n\\nWe dined outside and I felt tucked away in a Europe-esque atmosphere for a few hours.\\n\\nIt is worth reserving a spot on the patio to get the full experience.",
          "Passed this restaurant for years on my way to Buffalo Blues or more recently Mad Mex but have never actually eaten here.  Having finally come for lunch, I overall enjoyed it but it had some ups and some downs.  \\n\\nI ordered the Piccola Gusto Menu which for me included the Cream of Cauliflower soup, the Orecchiette Pasta and the Roasted Turkey Sandwich.  It sounds like a lot of food but the pasta serving is mini and it's a half sandwich.  For me, the size was just right.  The soup was awesome, and I could have eaten an entire lunch of just it.  The pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didn't have enough seasoning or spice.  I did love the addition of the cranberries in it though.  The perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream.  The roast turkey sandwich was just that.  Not out of this world, but not bad.  My biggest complaint was the service.  It took a really long time to get our meals which is always a bad thing during a weekday lunch.  \\n\\nI'd like to go back here for a happy hour when it's warm so I can enjoy the covered patio though and a nice glass of wine!",

I spent a lot, but I was ok with the occasional splurge. the second trip, i again bought my hit foods Palak Paneer and it had obviously gone over. \\n\\nEver have whoopsies after green Indian cuisine?\\n\\nIt's off my list now. Forever.",
          "- Great food. I had the Gerber's Amish Farm Chicken Breast and it was cooked perfectly and delicious =]\\n- Nice wine selection. Though I'm a beer guy.\\n- Friendly staff.\\n- Okay atmosphere.\\n\\nThis place is definitely worth trying. Will be back for seconds!",
          "The menu looks awesome and the dish concepts are good except everything that comes out is disappointingly bland. Thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table. The best part of the meal was the peanut butter chocolate milk shake. The burger and \\\"spicy\\\" Cajun soup were very mediocre.",
          "Beautiful decor. Very genuine staff. Very clean washrooms. Delicious food. I tried the market trio. The blackened tilapia was nice with a little bit of spice. This is a great place for a seafood lover.",
          "The service was lackluster. Coffee was warm but delicious. Limited to one cup, apparently, as the waitress never offered a second.\\n\\nDaughter had sweet and sour shrimp. Wife had spicy chicken. I had wonton soup. Dumplings as an appetizer for the table. All arrived warm. The brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems. Also dry as sand. I guess that is how they serve it.\\n\\nThe base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical. I had expected them to be more diverse. \\n\\nIn all, expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale. I'd rather have the local Chinese cuisine which more flavorful, and much less expensive.",
          "Food was only ok. Had lobster bisque soup not to good. Had the shang Hai Seafood Sampler. The scallops were hard, over cooked. The samon was good. Shrimp had no flavor. I will say the service was the best. Our waiter was great!!",
          "Recently dined here for the first time and can say that I was pleased with all of the food choices we had made at this establishment. The cold prickly pear soup was certainly a good choice of appetizer. The service was acceptable and the staff very welcoming. The only downside to this place is the atmosphere. It can get extremely loud at times (especially when you are sitting next to a party of 12) and it becomes rather difficult to have any table conversation.",
          "Just ate there, right next to GameStop & Google, has 3 small booths, & ordered the pepper steak w/ onion ($10.95). Food is fast fresh & hot, but mine had too much onion & not enough steak. At the end of the meal I was just eating onions with rice, though I hear this is healthy for you. Counter lady was cordial, but didn't reply when customers told her, \\\"Have a nice day\\\" #awkward. I know that English isn't her first language but she needs to catch on that people are wishing her well. Wasn't stuffed full either despite having eaten a large plate (I usually get this feeling eating Asian). This is basically a nice place to go for lunch that won't ruin your appetite for dinner. (Side note: Food is very clean. Brushed my teeth an hour before w/ Tom's of Maine fluoride-free peppermint & still had minty fresh breath an hour after eating)",
          "It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back.",
          "This place hit the spot. \\n\\nStopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. \\n\\nI recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)",
          "This is  a \\\"Okay\\\" place to eat.  The food is nothing special.  I guess what they have going for them is the beer.  Order the  Guacamole for the starter which was okay but for $8.50 and the portion was not worth it.  Rice (Cajun Taco) was not cooked well.  Would I go there again \\\"maybe\\\".  If your into beer and watching the game, then yeah go there.",
          "Small portions. Over priced food. Very small menu (dinner). Was OK, but disappointing overall.",
          "Went there for lunch and had a decent meal.  While the Mongolian Beef was beyond excellent, the Moo Goo Gai Pan was average (although I did enjoy the shrimp in it).  Service was fine and decor is pleasant.  For some reason I'm just not in the mood to write a detailed review - please accept my apologies.",
          "It's not that delish.",
          "Love this place. I've never had anything that wasn't tasty here. They do fish and meat very well. It's not obscure molecular gastronomy style, but dishes we have had here were all well prepared and savory. We have been to several business dinners in their space downstairs, and it really is my favorite place for these - even more than the pricier steakhouses 'dahntahn.'\\n\\nWait staff were very attentive, and really made our experiences here great. Food was served efficiently for large groups, and arrived at the correct temperature. They have a great wine list, and overall offer a comfortable space with delicious food and drinks. Try the lamb loin, chicken, and cioppino - my three current favorites. Their pork chops are the specialty of the house, I'm told.\\n\\nWill definitely be back.",
          "Another really good meal here!  My friend and I went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean!  Gazpacho, pasta fagiole, homemade bread, eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite...the roasted veggie platter.  So much food we didn't think we would eat it, but it was so good we did!  They also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer air--great way to kick of summer!",
          "Hey do I really need to review this place? Look at the previous reviews but I will let you know that they have a great lunch deal, the piccolo gusto menu. I highly recommend it because it is a heck of a deal and you can have tastes of a few different items so it pairs well with my self diagnosis of A.D.D. no offense to anyone who has A.D.D but it definitely kept my attention throughout my lunch experience. First off the service was excellent very attentive server who was really a foodie, which I really appreciated. She knew a heck of a lot about the seemingly simple dishes I had ordered. The Piccolo Forno allows for a choice of Salad or soup, a pasta or risotto, half sandwich. I went with a taste of the Pea Tendrils and Frisee Salad, while slightly complex to eat, it had a savory flavor from the light dressing and blue cheese crumbles, then I went with cauliflower risotto which was riculous. That is how you make risotto people. For the half samich I went with the half turkey. The turkey wasn't just a normal turkey slice from the deli counter this was actually very nicely trimmed meat off of a bird that was prepared in house and it was immediately noticeable. All this for $15 dollars, I'll take it....And I'll do it again many times over again. Come here for lunch sometime and check it for yourself.",
          "Although I wouldn't  travel out of my way to have dinner here, this is a resturant that I enjoy having a meal at, when I am in the Homestead water front. On all of my visits here I have enjoyed the tempura shrimp. The dipping sauce are to die for.  I've found myself craveing the tempura shrimp, and the accompanying sauces. \\n\\nThe first time I ever had dinner here was as a birthday dinner with me and my big sister. So this resturant has sentimental value to me. I attach eating here to having a special night out in the Waterfront. \\n\\nBar Louie has some very flavorful and fun dishes for bar food, that is.",
          "Not Tasty At All.",
          "The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.\\n\\nWhat really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there...",
          "Walking into Jimmy Tsang's was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.\\n\\nHot & Sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.\\nWonton Soup was a very large portion and good.\\n\\nEgg Rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.\\nCheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.\\nChinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.\\nFlaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.\\n\\nTea tasted like American Lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.\\n\\nThe place was clean service was good, prices are very good, but the food was just average.",
          "Went for dinner Friday evening with friends and sat at the outdoor patio. It is so nice and relaxing there with the river and bike trail. The sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh. The Chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth, it was awesome. The Cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good. I had the carrot cake for dessert, it is big enough for 3 people. It was so delicious. My friend had the creme  br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, which she said was very good. I was here 3 times this summer and every meal was excellent.",
          "My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around.",
          "Was very disappointed with the food. It was overcooked and not seasoned very well",
          "Service an atmosphere was great. I had the shrimp boil and it was very under-seasoned. Much closer to bland than anything.",
          "Very tasty food and drinks! Its a little pricey, but worth it if you want something better than a typical chain.",
          "Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.",
          "I have eaten some very good dinners here.  Although it's a chain, I would say it's several notches above the other chain restaurants.  The chef here seems to add some creativity to the menu, so I will be definitely back again soon.",

          "I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \\\"nice\\\" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.\\n\\nIt was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\\n\\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.",
          "To be honest, I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all.",
          "Good selection, but it will cost you.\\nMultiple fridges of cold beer, but only the cheap beer is cold.\\nNice in person, but rude on the phone.\\nParking lot, but none of the customers understand how to park.\\n\\nEvery good thing about this place is equaled with a bad thing about this place - hence it probably deserves 3 stars. I would really give it a 3.5 if available as this is currently my beer distributor of choice, but since its not possible I have to go with 4.\\n\\nWhy 4 you ask, when I just went through all that 3 star crap? Any place that offers beer samples provided by attractive women gets a half star boost for sure, and as long as I'm going there anyway it really makes for a more interesting trip.\\n\\nAfter all, if you don't like free beer, you are probably a terrorist.",
          "I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. \\n\\nBuffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\\n\\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \\n\\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\\n\\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.",
          "I rarely give a business a superior rating, but I have to say my wife and I had one of the best dining experiences at the Rock Bottom Brewery.   The food was delicious,  the beer, every recipe sampled,  was amazing and the service was wonderful.  The staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant. \\n\\nPlease support this business.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",
          "Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  As expected, the bar was lively, the food was good, and the service was accommodating,  The beers are better than Church Brew Works and the bar was populated.  The bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl.  \\nI vote for Rock Bottom as the anchor store of the Water Works.",
          "Not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worst.\\n\\nI like the food and I have tried all the beers.  They're just \\\"OK\\\" as far as beer goes.\\n\\nLarge portions. Friendly staff.",
          "Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.",
          "I found Buffalo Blues to be merely OK.  I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small.  I actually liked the wing sauces I tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic).  Our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive.  \\n\\nI would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was OK.\\n\\nSurprisingly, lots of vegetarian options.  A vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.",
          "The absolute worst service I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt.  And, in looking at other reviews, I am not the first.  There are many options at the Waterfront, and I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place!",
          "This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout.",
          "Oh how the mighty have fallen. This place used to be good. Something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad. Since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable.\\n\\nWriting this review makes me sad because it is a great place to drink beer and watch the game. The beer is reasonably priced but the food is just expensive for what it is. I essentially live across the street so I know I'll go back, but I hope some of these poor reviews will help them turn things around in the kitchen.",
          "I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly.",
          "In the last week I've been here twice, partially because I don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty good! It's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.\\n\\nI tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than Sharp Edge's. The sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. To wash it down I had Loose Cannon beer, how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!\\n\\nOur waitress was a little slow, she said it was her first night. Who makes a new girl work on a Friday night! She seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because I wasn't hungry anymore so I didn't care.\\n\\nThe beer was pricy - Tuesday night I had a maker's sour for the same price as a pint of beer...",
          "Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \\\"OK\\\".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \\n\\nTheir food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.\\n\\nI feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens!",
          "Their food is okay and beer selection is diverse and good. \\n\\nThe problem i have with the place is that Buffalo Bills fans congregate here and cheer on every mediocre play their football team makes, (or almost makes) so it's like watching the Superbowl except it's a losing record team stopping a team on third down.",
          "Its not bad. I'm not into chain kind of places, but if you're with a group that doesn't do anything more adventurous, you'll do fine here. I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars but the house beer I had will make sure I come back from time to time.",
          "Good fun place to watch games while drinking and eating chicken wings or sandwiches.They have a good selection of wings and decent beer. I try different kinds of wings  every time  I go in but so far spicy garlic has been my favorite. This is a typical sports bar.",
          "Good place to watch a sports game.  Beer specials were good. Food is very overpriced though.  The wings are about the worst I've ever had... and I've had alot of wings growing up in Buffalo, NY.",
          "Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead is always a good time.  They brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  Saturday night C and I stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  \\n\\nOur first issue of the night was getting to Rock Bottom.  As the restaurant is located in Homestead, a trip across the Hi Level Bridge was in order.  Little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.  Upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task.  This place was absolutely packed due to several locations sharing a parking lot.  After we got inside, our wait was about 45 minutes but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.\\n\\nThe food at Rock Bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.  They also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.\\n\\nOur order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas and Ball Park Pretzels.  We had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. \\n\\nThe nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken.  Containing just the right amount of jalapenos they had a nice little kick as well.  In much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion.  With shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree.  The Ball Park Pretzels are the reason we come to this place.  They are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.\\n\\nAs far as the beers are concerned, I ordered up the sampler so that I could get a taste of the various brews.  They make a wide assortment of brews, from the Bud Lightesque \\\"Lumpy Dog\\\" to a dark \\\"Brew masters Choice.\\\"  I found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them.  I would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the Rock Bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack.  Don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but I would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.\\n\\nI give it 3 out of 5 Rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place.",
          "Wing night wednesdays! 50 cent price wings and $1 beer at William Penn on Tuesdays and my body is not hurting too badly the next day, Buffalo Blues for all you can eat wings. There are a ton of sauces to pair with these wings. They bring them out 5 at a time so plan on ordering your next selection when your wings come out because they take quite a bit of time to come. I don't think I have ever eaten the other food here except for the wings because they are pretty good. The only downside to this place is that service is really really slow.",
          "So, I went to Buffalo Blues tonight for the second time (not the second time tonight, the second time in my life) for dinner and some drinks, and to sum up my experience in a few words, both times it was about what I expected.  Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.\\n\\nI'll start with the drinks.  They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM).   Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.\\n\\nThe menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain.  One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.\\n\\nI know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars.  This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the \\\"word versions\\\" of the ratings that Yelp gives us.  \\\"A-OK,\\\" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.  The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.  It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.\\n\\nTo sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.  Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but \\\"just fine.\\\"  But I'm sure I'll go back there for happy hour again sometime.",
          "I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another \\\"brewery\\\" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp!",
          "I would take advantage of All you can eat wings on Wednesday. \\n\\nWe went on a regular oll Sunday night and even though the wings were tasty, my frugal self would've rather had AYCE. We tried a variety of sauces (we ordered 20 wings and every 5 can be a different flavor) The Buffalo Blues sauce was ok. It was just their signature bbq sauce. WE also tried garlic parm, honey teriyaki & gold rush. All were ok.\\n\\n The boozy buffalo is a good drink. It consist of smirnoff orange, tanquery, jose cuervo, captain, triple sec, OJ, fresh squeezed lemon and a splash of Coke. I seriously felt fabulous after one. It's served in a mason jar. ($12)\\n\\nLauren was a nice server even though the table in front of us put her through some bs-- they ate all of their food then complained to the server and asked for the manager complaining that what they got it wasn't what they ordered... no idea why they waited until every scrap of food was gone to complain but you know, you'll have that. kudos to Lauren for keeping a smile on her face.",
          "I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\\n\\nThey have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. \\n\\nIt is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. \\n\\nThe biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. \\nTheir fries are very good. And so are the wings.\\n\\nI'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.",
          "Food: 2 stars. It's really not very good. Especially the entirety of the combination platter they make with chicken fingers and wings. Blue cheese wasn't bad though. My wedge salad was enormous- more like a half head of lettuce than a wedge. Nice and fresh though. \\n\\nDrinks: 3 stars, for the decent variety (better than expected from a place like this) and the game time specials.\\n\\nService: 3 stars. Could have been better, could have been worse. Friendly but unattentive and not good at realizing when to come to the table. (Hint: if one person calls you over for a drink, make sure the rest of us are set before running away.) \\n\\nAtmosphere: 4 stars - really good job of having enough televisions for everyone to see the game/s and marking each so you know what's on. \\n\\n1 Bonus star for accommodating the Pittsburgh area Buffalo Bills fans! GO BILLS!!!",
          "Delicious wings - sometimes a bit too deep fried for my taste, but really tasty flavors and spices. We went for all-you-can-eat wings night but sadly I could barely finish my first dozen. Beer selection is much improved since  Turadg A.'s post; they have about 30 or so available to choose from.",
          "I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  \\n\\nI love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  \\n\\nHowever, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it's not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.",
          "The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews. Food was \\\"eh\\\", not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didn't text them back. This place has the potential to be great, but sadly, it falls way too short in almost all areas.",
          "I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \\n\\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \\n\\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \\n\\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss!",
          "Wednesday is Wing night, i.e., eat your face off night. For ~ $9 you can eat unlimited wings (with your choice of various sauces) for several hours. If you can, top it off with a brownie - they're quite good.\\n\\nI've mostly had the wings at Blues & I like all of the sauces, but the burgers are good, as well. Whatever you do, make sure to get the sweet potato fries & tip your waitress! (Especially if her name is Meg).",
          "I have mixed feelings about this place.  I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\\n\\nThey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\\n\\nThe food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entr\\u00e9e, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entr\\u00e9e salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.\\n\\nUpshot?  In the absence of a new sports bar opening up, we'll be back next season, but not before then.",
          "The best thing about Buffalo Blues revolves around Sundays during football season. For me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an NFL game...especially if you're not a Steelers fan. On any given Sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the NFL taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. Seating is the only issue. Get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. Luckily, the TV's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.\\n\\nThe draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by East End Brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, PBR), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nAs far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. I've had mostly great service at the bar, but I've also had average to below average service at tables. During bigger sporting events - primarily Steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.\\n\\nOverall, I have to rate the food as average. I LOVE their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. Their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. The fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. I think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. The menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. It's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.\\n\\nIn the end, I'm giving Buffalo Blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a \\\"sports bar.\\\" As far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. They always get a good crowd for games (whether Sundays during the NFL season, Saturdays during big college games, or for Pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. There's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds I've experience in other sports bars in town. Most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in Shadyside for lunch and dinner.",

          "There's nothing like a Saturday night filled with some good laughs, a few chuckles and a couple of good guffaws thrown in for good measure.  That's exactly what we enjoyed on Saturday night!\\n\\nWe hit the comedy club for an evening of Tammy Pescatelli - the hubby and I have enjoyed her routine on TV and on the occasional DVE morning show..  She didn't fail to give us a good evening of laughs!  The big surprise, was Gene Collier - yep, of the Post-Gazette sports writer fame - as the opener.  What a great opening act!  He cracked wise about the perils of being 58 and a baby boomer.  We could relate!\\n\\nThe sightlines were lacking.  There was a rather large woman at the table in front of us with massive Pittsburgh BIG HAIR.  All night long my own head bobbed from side to side as I attempted to actually watch the show, and not just listen to it, as she reached repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snacks.  \\n\\nWith a 2 drink minimum, my first drink was weak and the 2nd was quite strong!  All in all, the two balanced each other out.  But then, you don't go for the drinks, do you?  An enjoyable evening!",
          "What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road, because I could see myself being a regular here.\\n\\nHonestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  \\n\\nI am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time, I am bringing a big group of friends.",
          "The musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd, so I can't say they are all bad.  However the minimum for a song request is $5.  I spent $20 on a song for my girlfriend and they NEVER played it!!  They were playing songs for $5 and $10, but my $40 got me no where.  Even if they didn't know the song, which I doubt, they could have picked one they knew and improvised,  my tip, save your $$ on the requests.\\n\\nOtherwise it's fun for special events every once in awhile.",
          "Most definitely, I'm a fan of this joint. There are fabulous, high-quality displays of glass art, and they offer lots of learning opportunities if you want to make your own glass art or functional glass pieces. Plus, on gallery crawl nights (First Friday of every month!) they have snacks galore.",
          "My best friend took me to Sing Sing for my bachelor party. I had a blast. The musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. They also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected \\\"Rock Bottom\\\" restaurant for some grub. We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.\\n\\nThere were some drawbacks though. We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. But it's not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday, if their drinks weren't so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. Also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch. I'll probably be back, but only for a special occasion when I can afford it.",
          "i had fun here.. fun big kid games for me!!!\\nO.. But the bartender Melissa was a SUPER bitch and RUDE \\nHope they fire her..",
          "Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!\\n\\nIt was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! \\n\\nI had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! \\n\\nI did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can't wait to go back!",
          "They have good acts coming around here, and often give out free tickets, particularly ine summer. I've never actually paid full price for a ticket here. \\n\\nThe two-item minimum is bit bothersome to me though...I don't mind the requirement so much, but the quality isn't good and the prices are high. Our four items total came to about $30 (two appetizers and two beers) and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the servers aren't even very friendly. Also beware...they have a lot of rules here. They won't seat till the whole party is there; if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party HAS to order dinner, automatic gratuity added to the check, etc. etc.\\n\\nThe \\\"box office\\\" is also weird...you get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slide-under slot...then you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there, so I don't get the whole hoopla with the window.\\n\\nAll in all though, the seats are comfy enough, the atmosphere is pretty nice, and the acts are good.",
          "Had a great time at Sing Sing a while ago with friends.  Friendly staff.  Will return.",
          "i was here for a concert the other night. apparently, there's much more to the venue than the side we were on where the stage was, but it was a pretty small area for a pretty big crowd. ok, so we arrived shortly before the opening act and ordered beers. $4 for a yuengling bottle isn't ideal, but whatever. we snagged a table with stools near the door before too many people got there. by the time the opener was over, the place was packed shoulder to shoulder, and whether we stood or remained on our stools, it was nearly impossible to see the stage.\\ni liked that it was an intimate venue, but that many people packed into such a small space, with expensive drinks, and not even a good view? not the best venue i've ever been to...",
          "Eh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a Saturday night.\\n\\nBobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait.",
          "Pretty fun place to go every once in a while, but, believe me, by the end of the night you'll be ready to go. The show lasts around 5 hours, by the 3 hour mark you'll be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your $9 a pop drinks listening to the same dirty jokes over and over and over again.",
          "In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me.\\n\\nThe 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the Rock Bottom brews they serve.",
          "I'm HUGE SNL fan, so naturally if someone who's been in the cast is touring, I'll come here to see them. Some have been really great...Jim Breuer. Some have been (surprisingly) very bad....Tracy Morgan. But it's always been a pleasant experience at the venue.  There's not a bad seat in the house and it's small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage.  Beware if you sit in the very front, you KNOW what's going to happen!\\n\\nA couple downsides.... \\n\\nWaiting outside in a line in the dead of winter.  The lobby is so small you're forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show let's out.  And if you want a good seat, you may be waiting in line for a while.  BURR!\\n\\nThe two drink minimum. I kinda get why they do it, to make money, of course. But this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks. Better to stick with beer and wine at these places. No frou frou drinks for me! \\n\\nAlso, as to be expected, the food's not that great. In a perfect foodie world, places that served food would make it fantastic! Since that's not going to happen, you just go into those places hoping for the best. I've never had anything great here. Nacho platter too many re fried beans, to little nacho's....annnnnd I'm out! \\n\\nSo what did we learn here? Good venue, stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand. The talent is really what you're there for so, enjoy the show!",
          "Went there last night with 8 peeople. There was another 14 people party.\\n\\nThe food was good -- not great but good. We waited 45 minutes for the first dish to arrive and that only because we sent one of our folk to see what was going on. \\n\\nThey did bring drinks and tea promptly.",
          "I went to a yelp event here, where we were able to make a fused glass piece and also watch some demonstrations and go to the gallery. Everything in the gallery was amazing. The demonstrations were neat, and the fused glass was something I would go back to do again.\\n\\nI really didn't know that the glass center was open most of the time, and if you go there on any random day, you can watch whatever is going on. I think that is pretty cool! They also have classes where you can blow glass or make beads or whatever you want... I can't wait to pick up my piece and come back for another class!",
          "I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations, which was good because it was packed that Saturday night. The performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, \\\"you bitch, you slut, you whore\\\" and  \\\"twinkle twinkle little slut, why don't you take it up the butt\\\" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. Or maybe not.",
          "Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! :) Great humor too!! :)",
          "It's surprising how long it took me to get here, then I hear a rumor they're moving soon anyway! Geez... way to be behind the times Rachel!\\n\\nI've been interested in a bunch of the nights they've hosted before, but have never made way way over. I went to celebrate one Miss Aja J's birthday for Hip Hop vs House night. I'm a big hip hop fan, but not much into house. They had two dueling DJ's and an MC hosting the event. I actually liked the mash up of the two genre's. It was definitely better than just house.\\n\\nThey have about 5 beers on tap, which I think is impressive for a \\\"club.\\\" Especially different since it was much more than Miller Light. They actually had a Pumpkin brew on tap, which forgive me for not remember, I was into! At $5.50 it wasn't breaking the bank, but it wasn't a $3 Miller Light fo sho! \\n\\nWe came a little early, but it seemed like the night really started to pick up around 11pm. Yep, I'm old, I left at 11pm. Lame, I know! \\n\\nI hope they find a new home, because I think it's a place we don't have anywhere else and I'm happy to have been finally!",
          "This was my second visit to the club and it was still a blast. My girlfriends bought tickets for John Witherspoon for my bachelorette. We were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious! He was wonderful. \\n\\nThe servers were fantastic. They always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink. I suggest the Pink Cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. \\n\\nThe only reason it isn't 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm. They came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldn't be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm. It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building, order drinks then the show finally started at 9:45pm.  The host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late.",
          "He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls.",
          "I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!  My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren't cheap (around $10-12).  However, I would definitely go back sometime!",
          "This place has gone significantly down hill.  I've gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.",
          "Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. \\n\\nShut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. \\n\\nMy big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.",
          "My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \\n\\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? \\n\\nIn addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. \\n\\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. \\n\\nThe Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.",
          "Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet \\\"waterfront\\\" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.\\n\\nWhen it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.\\n\\nBut today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song you're the piano man has run it's course. I don't hate Sing Sing, but I could never come here more than once a year. It's a been there, done that kind of place.",
          "My girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last Saturday. I highly suggest that you make reservations because we were able to just walk right in and sit down. There were people there waiting 30 minutes+. We had the sangria which was amazing. Our sever Alex recommend it and it was perfect for the 4 of us.  I had their thin crust pepperoni pizza which really hit the spot. My two friend had salads which they said were amazing and my other friend joined me in ordering a pesto chicken pizza. Let's just say there wasn't any food left on the table when we were finished.  I will be back for sure.",
          "Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend Rock Bottom. Couldn't be happier!",
          "There were zero other people here aside from my friend and I.",
          "Good club for a good laugh. High food prices (most comedy clubs are), 2 item min. The food was less than stellar. I wouldve enjoyed Burger King more. \\n\\nService was decent, I believe the waiters/waitresses could hustle a little more or the club should hire more waiters/waitresses. I get grouchy when my glass is sitting empty for more than 2 mins.",

          "Loved the hot vegetarian sandwich. Not easy to find veggie dishes which don't feel like a compromise. This was great. Excellent service from waitress Ariella with the long black pony tail (don't know her last name). Nice casual atmosphere. Resonable prices.",
          "Why do vegetarian restaurants think we need \\\"fake\\\" meat, this I do not understand.  I had a primavera sandwich which was just ok, but the patty on the roll was just as perplexing as the \\\"mystery meat\\\" you get in your elementary school cafeteria. My sandwich came with a boring pasta salad and some tortilla chips out of a bag.  Otherwise the atmosphere was fun, and the wifi was free if you ask for the password.",
          "My experience has been ok at the Quiet Storm because I have 1) not deviated much from my usual menu choice (Original Home Fries = delicious) and 2) I have often known several members of the wait staff at any given time.\\n\\nThis has given me reason to continue eating at Quiet Storm on occasion.\\n\\nNegatives... I have eaten with several others over the years who have been wholly dissatisfied with their meals (small portions, not enough seasonings, could taste baking soda flavor in baked goods, etc). Service can be a little slow at times. And I have been burned a few times when going out of my way (it is a little off the beaten path for many) to score some delicious Home Fries only to find that the QS had inexplicably closed early.\\n\\nDespite this, FOR PITTSBURGH, the QS is a good spot for vegan/vegetarian fare.",
          "They have these tofu tenders, which are akin to a vegan buffalo wing.  I can't put my finger on it, as there really doesn't appear to be much to them in terms of some sort of secret cooking technique, but holy crap, I can't get enough of them!  I had 3 orders in 2 days, and since it's tofu & not some greasy wings... it's a legitimately healthy meal/snack.\\nThe Cheesy Snake -- a vegetarian cheese steak -- can be made with vegan cheese, and it's pretty slammin, too.  \\nThe slaw tastes like liking a brick of salt, and the coffee etiquette -- pouring old pots into other, half-full pots -- leaves a bit to be desired, but overall, I know that it's one of a few places in Pittsburgh that serves vegan food that's pretty awesome.",
          "i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic.  however, i have visited multiple times now continuously hoping for improvement and each time i've been disappointed.  let's start with the good things.  QS has a great atmosphere, it definitely helped the transition from austin.  very chill \\\"hippie\\\" vibe.  however, the servers although friendly can  sometimes be a touch \\\"hippie-elitest\\\".  the food was alright.  their homefries were quite tasty but little else has tantalized my taste buds and i have tried many things.  i do love their thai dressing, very yummy on the salads.  will i continue to go back?  probably, wishful thinking is  a good thing.",
          "Quiet storm is a really cool vegetarian restaurant. The time I was there the service was fine and the food was unique. Their menu is a limited on the weekdays, your best bet is one of their many quesadillas.\\n\\nI'm not as concerned about the preservation of vibe and atmosphere, as long as the food still tastes good. I was in love with the pierogidilla and happy to leave the table feeling full without having any meat.\\n\\nI wrote a review of Quiet Storm on my web site, Binge! http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/07/07/ive-got-an-itch-for-kitsch-quiet-storm-in-bloomfield/",
          "Quiet Storm is a delicious and cozy little place located in the colorful Bloomfield area. The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! \\n\\nI've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan \\\"cheese\\\" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. \\n\\nThe second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. \\n\\nQuiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) \\n\\nTip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. \\n\\nYou may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water.",
          "Food is tasty, though portions are for the waifish hipster types. Location is inconvenient and I would not recommend people walking by themselves at night on that stretch of Penn. Service is very uneven i.e. bad, even when the place is practically dead. I can't really speak on the coffee, though they do have good tissanes(however getting them to refill your hot water is another thing).\\n\\n**************\\nOkay I won't change my rating, but I take back what I said about the food. They have changed the menu and it is really bad. \\n\\nWe had Buffalo Tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry. \\n\\nI had the Thai Peanut Tofu Wrap which tasted just like peanut butter. \\n\\nI don't understand the point of Mockamole? It's made with peas instead of avocado. \\n\\nHow to describe the food... it's as if they took pictures of how food should look and made the food without thinking about how food should taste. Gee peas are green, just like avocados?? \\n\\nI would go there for coffee/tea or whatever to hang out, but not for the food. \\n\\nOkay there was one decent thing on the menu which was the artichoke dip. I was completely disappointed.",
          "So I admit my boyfriend and I actually didn't know it was vegetarian/vegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely.\\n \\nWe went this past weekend and had brunch. We each had thai coffee which was ok, not stupendous, not horrible. He ordered the veggie burger, and I had the chocolate oatmeal pancakes.\\n\\nHis burger was unseasoned and fairly cold, my pancakes were okay...but to be honest really lacked flavor (the taste of what I imagine cardboard to be came to mind). I don't discriminate, I'm all for veggies and vegan food, but just because those are your ingredients doesn't mean you can't cook things well and add seasoning.\\n\\nI am intrigued to go back because the apple cheese panini sounded possibly better than what we had.  \\n\\nI will note that ourwaitress was very sweet and friendly, but the food was just lacking in flavor so much that it's really deterred us from going back.",
          "I'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. It just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd.\\n\\nA small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But \\\"Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings\\\" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their \\\"chorizo\\\" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed \\\"foods.\\\"\\n\\nLess processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, \\\"Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat\\\"? I have! But don't expect that feeling here. It will be more like: \\\"Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?\\\"\\n\\nTwo stars because I really like the drinks here. The ones I remember trying were the ginger lemonade, the Mexican hot chocolate, and the root beer with a shot of espresso. They have some really wonderful sounding tea options that I wish I could try, but I generally avoid this place because of the food.",
          "I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep finding myself hungrily returning to the Quiet Storm. The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the \\\"8th Ward\\\" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as \\\"garlicky\\\" on the menu. Sooo wrong. \\\"The Butter,\\\" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.\\n\\nAt this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. \\n\\nI wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction. And it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary (I shutter at even calling it that) mediocrity of \\\"the best\\\" vegetarian restaurant Pittsburgh has to offer.",
          "This place is a train wreck. Quiet? No. Storm? Yes. Loud, slow, bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that I have.\\n \\n1. The Vegan / Hipster / Metal thing has got to go. All I kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the Mot\\u00f6rhead tank top. I am a huge Mot\\u00f6rhead fan, but when I go to an overpriced restaurant I don't want Lemmy to be making my food.\\n \\n2. The food is bland. Shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100% vegan.\\n \\n3. The service was pretty bad. Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.\\n \\n4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.\\n \\nI have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and Quiet Storm does not even come close to the top 10. I think Pittsburgh deserves better.",
          "Delicious!! Not a vegetarian, but this place might convince me to switch over. Had a few breakfast options and was blown away by the Greek plate and the QTF. Excellent coffee too.",
          "I've been back to Quiet Storm many times. I can accept the hit or miss service since it's pretty cheap and casual. That's not really an excuse for bad service, it only somehow softens the blow, but why be mediocre? \\n\\nThe environment is comfortable (unless you sense the servers don't want you there). The music ranges and is appropriate for the environment. It's never too loud or aggressive. Free wi-fi helps and the milkshakes are slammin! The food is inconsistent, but often good. The Black-a-dilla is my favorite. \\n\\nI really want to like Quiet Storm, but it only merits 2 stars. Their food, service, and hours are inconsistent. It seems they often close early. \\n\\nOwners, please stick to your business hours. It's not like you're open that late to begin with! Perhaps everybody wants to go home, I don't blame them for that, and you may have run out of a few things, but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away.  \\n\\nOR, If you believe this is an acceptable business practice, it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to '9am - until we feel like it.'  This way there are no set expectations and we can't really begrudge you for it. \\n\\n...My vote is to just stick with the hours you created.\\n\\nThanks!",
          "I love quiet storm! I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. The country burrito is BOMB! So good, there has to be crack in the gravy. I also enjoy the tahini queso, I often add it to my burrito. It's best on the nachos. For around $13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast/brunch coffee/tea included. They also have great pastries & dairy free coffee drinks & milkshakes! It's a vegan dream come true. It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait, but completely worth it. The atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (Garfield) which also means they often play good music! Last time I was there it was all Neil Young! Accompanied my burrito perfectly! I definitely recommend this place to vegans & NON-vegans alike!",
          "Remember the days of bands in the back at night, and interesting kids hanging out at the bar all day? Well, the bands were the first to go, followed quickly by the comfy sofas. The kids didn't take long to leave, and now, years later, faced with a frankly less-than-appetizing Saturday menu, I find that the ability to substitute something else for the increasing amounts of potato filler is gone, too.\\n\\nQuiet Storm used to be a straight five star. My last experience was honestly two-star, but nostalgia and history don't allow me to give it less than a three.\\n\\nI'm sure all the changes over the years have been in the name of efficiency, but they've come at expense to the clientele. Here's hoping Quiet Storm rediscovers the mojo (and the menu) that once made them great.",
          "I don't think I would have known about Quiet Storm if it hadn't popped up several times in friends' Yelp feeds in the last couple years.  I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  \\n\\nHusband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\\u00e9.  Both were excellent.\\n\\nFor my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.\\n\\nAnd that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.  When really, I'd been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables, plain grains and humble legumes.  Still, I won't discourage you from eating here.  I just might come back myself.",
          "My friend and I were having a weekend trip to Pittsburgh (first time!) and stopped in for brunch on Sunday before our visit to the nearby Pittsburgh Glass Center. We weren't familiar with the area & this looked like a cute place- ended up definitely enjoying our time here!\\n\\nWe weren't aware that it was a vegan place; regardless, the drinks menu & and the brunch menu both looked amazing. Friend ordered the Nyam, which she said was very filling (surprisingly). I had the the Country burrito, which definitely surpassed my expectations. Decent, good. \\n\\nFriend & I both ordered the Don Juan mocktail which was the highlight of the meal- holy crap! AMAZINGLY GOOD- I always think that horchata tastes a little too watery but the coconut juice & caramel helps round out the drink & make my tastebuds sing. I'm only sad that I can't keep visiting and trying more of their drinks. \\n\\nMight not necessarily go out of my way to come back BUT I would definitely go again if I were in the area. :)",
          "I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?\\n\\nThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.\\n\\nAND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early.",
          "Yes, I know.  I'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.\\n\\nBut let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to \\\"look in the back\\\" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\\n\\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I will not be coming back to this place.",
          "Quiet Storm occupies a special place in my heart compartment because, one lazy Sunday in 2004, I discovered Alfred Bester's The Demolished Man. Imagine my joy: a cyberpunk fan, finding a tattered copy of some anonymous-looking book in some proto-hipster cafe (this was back before it was toooo hipster), and discovering the glories of Alfred Bester. (Seriously, The Demolished Man is good.) It also fit in perfectly with the blue collar/gentrified charm of Pittsburgh in general, and the Hill District/Lawrenceville/Bloomfield in particular.\\n\\nAnyway. I have returned now in 2011 for a veg brunch, and it was a pleasant, if not-so-good-value-for-money experience. I got the True Grits (yeah, Jeff Bridges, yeah), which was a HUGE bowl of grits (some shaved, grocery store-feeling cheddar on top), a pile of delicious, chopped lemony kale, some pretty blah scrambled eggs and a large glass of cranberry juice (very healthy!). Overall, it was fine. I didn't like the $12 price tag so much (seriously, grits is pioneer food and you're charging me $12!), nor did I dig the shades of hipper-than-thou among the clientele, but shrug shrug.",
          "I'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years. Every time I have ever gone, the service is awful. It's as if they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. I think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw. Also, the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine. the one great thing about this place is their coffee, and that's it.",
          "I was somewhat worried about going here since the reviews seem to be bimodal, so I was pleasantly surprised when our food was flavorful (some reviewers complained of blandness) and not trying to imitate meat (some reviewers said that seemed to be the goal), but exploiting the wonderfulness of vegetables and scrambled tofu (which, despite the other complaints, was just fine). We had the \\\"tenders\\\" appetizer, with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce, but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan, you would like that too. We all thought it was wonderful. On the advice of the server, I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy, heavily peanut-flavored, but full of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili, that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!), but the apple panini (with \\\"seisage\\\", cheese, etc.) was very good. Finally, Panchu had the coconut burrito, which was huge, but he ate the whole thing, and was very happy. We all split a vegan cinnamon roll for dessert, and I really wish I had been able to get my own!\\n\\nSome complained about the wait; I think this place fits well with the \\\"slow food movement.\\\" If you want fast food, go to McDonald's.\\n\\nSo, based on one observation, I gave it five stars. YMMV.",
          "Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!",
          "Me and my kids got food togo from here, because it came recommended from someone at the local food co-op as a place with good vegan options.\\n\\nCute and attractive DIY style decor.\\nFriendly staff.\\n\\nI really liked the food quite a lot (i'de give it 4/5 stars).  GOt a tofu banh mi with a side salad.  When I asked what dressing they had, I expected to hear the list of \\\"usual\\\" uninspiring dressings that vev/non-veg restaurants often have.  The first one she mentioned was a green chili dressing tasted as fun and yummy as it sounded.\\n\\nMy kids didn't really love their vegan homefries meal (with scrambled tofu and a weird vegan cheese sauce thang).\\n\\nAnyhoo.  Really pleasantly surprised with this joint, and the food was pretty reasonably priced.  \\n\\nAs with any place I review, I am subtracting a star because they aren't all veg.  Anyplace selling eggs dairy and flesh isn't perfect for me.  I'de probably really call this 3.5 stars.",
          "Honestly, this the last place you'd ever expect to see me. First it's a vegan/veggie cafe, I am a complete carnivore. Secondly, it's like hipster brunch paradise, I'm super preppy (a heavily tattoed preppy person but still).  Yet this was one of the only places open on Labor Day and I walked in with my vegan friend, she immediately recognized her people and practically jizzed in her pants over the menu. OMG seitan gravy and cheez?\\n\\nWTF is seitan gravy and cheez? Why does she keep calling vegan cheese, \\\"cheez\\\" anyway? I decided to go with the flow and order the Home Fries Ranchero. Basically their \\\"famous\\\" home fries, chili, sour cream, eggs or tofu and cheez. I went native and ordered tofu vs eggs, and you know what? I liked it. It came out in a big heaping pile on a 70s retro plastic plate, accompanied with some awesome coffee. My friend had hummus and pita, cause not only is she vegan she only eats things in the white/beige color range (food racist).\\n\\nOne bad thing, the bathroom has no door, only the stall does. Basically it's a unisex bathroom where all the delightful sounds and smells can be experienced by diners directly in front of you. For a place that serves chili and \\\"cheez\\\" they may want to reconsider this open approach.\\n\\nThere are some previous reviews about arrogant hipsters/bad service etc. I have say our waitress was awesome and attentive. My coffee was filled routinely, she understood that requesting a \\\"buttload\\\" of cream meant a larger carafe of cream rather than a thimble. The host was apologetic for making us wait for more than a few minutes to sit down.I do admit it does have the indie coffee house feel, and yes hipsters abound here, but I have a feeling these are some legit hipsters. Not the trust fund having, whiny, I drink PBR, and annoy people with my smugness style hipster.  I bet these hipsters been squezzing their junk into tight pants long before I was born. I don't know, I just get that impression. \\n\\nI however feel a little weird for writing such a positive review on a uber crunchy place, so I feel the need to go slash tires on someone's Prius now.",
          "This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \\\"chicken maputo\\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\\\".  Does the average diner know what \\\"maputo\\\" and \\\"piri piri\\\" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\\n\\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.",
          "I didn't realize that Quiet Storm was a completely vegetarian restaurant until I noticed the word \\\"seitan\\\" printed after every meat item on the menu. Normally I'd find this annoying, as I'm an unabashed and unapologetic meat eater. That doesn't mean I don't love a good veggie dish, but fake meat masquerading as real meat is one of my pet peeves. If you're going to serve vegetarian food, don't try to pretend it's anything else.\\n\\nThat grievance having been aired, I ordered the Blackadilla, a quesadilla boasting no false meat items, but stuffed with black beans, basmati rice, sweet potatoes, pineapple and cheddar cheese. It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. \\n\\nThe menu at Quiet Storm is large, with breakfast and lunch/dinner items as well as an array of cafe drinks and desserts. In spite of the prevalence of seitan and tofu, there are a number of dishes that I look forward to sampling upon return.\\n\\nAnd I do plan to return. As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating.\\n\\nThe one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either. It has to be a pre-determined destination rather than a drop in for random passersby. But that might just be OK.",
          "Quiet Storm is, perhaps, the most expensive vegetarian diner I have ever been to, even by big city standards! Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.\\n\\nF.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing. It was quite good that way and I might recommend that QS rethink the Gyro presentation if they want to continue using so much lettuce.",
          "Daniel Fast friendly restaurant with good food. Stopped for an early supper before Saturday night church service after searching Yelp for vegan restaurant options. Food was good, service was good, price was very reasonable. Think I just found a new Saturday evening supper spot.",

          "My wife and I have been going here for as long as we have lived in Pittsburgh, which is about 10 years.  This is our go-to Chinese restaurant, even after we moved out of the neighborhood.  I have never had a bad meal here, and I will forever love their beef chow fun!  My wife and I are moving to North Carolina in two days, and Tasty Chinese was the thing about Pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most.  These are great folks, and I wish them the best of success in the future.  Remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!  Some people just have lousy taste buds, and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with.  Try things for yourself, and you will find some great food at Tasty!",
          "Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area.  No matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork, everything tastes off--like it's been overcooked in mop-bucket-water.  Try House of Lee instead.",
          "I think 2 or 3 stars is accurate for this joint... The chicken is quality meat and its lightly saut\\u00e9ed but the sauce is to blah. It's a nice place to sit down and have Chinese food if you have no other local options.  \\n\\nIt's my last resort for Chinese food in the area. Prices are absurd!!!",
          "I seriously don't know why people love this place so much, the food here is horrible. The rice is never cooked properly.. And it's not even Asian food. It's fake asian food. I never come here anymore.",

Every time my fiance and I go to this PF Chang's, we get the best service.  Food isn't the most authentic chinese food we've ever had, hence the 4 stars.  It is a bit overpriced as well, but the service makes up for it.",
          "So I moved to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles. I know I know I know!\\nAnyway so theres absolutely no places in Homestead that delivered Chinese so I decided to walk down to the closest Chinese food/restaurant to my house. \\n\\nThe family that runs the restaurant is very friendly. I read a review about them on Google that said the  mom looks like she might want to cook you alive. Don't believe it!\\n\\nOn this visit I ordered the Steamed Dumplings(recommended by some reviewer on google...THAT LIAR) and the Vegetable Chow Fun. I generally enjoy steamed dumplings but these dumplings(too much dumpling little meat) werent so good. Theyll probably be sitting in my mini fridge tomorrow and I'll force myself to eat them when I have the munchies/starving to death. The Vegetable Chow Fun on the other hand verrrrrrrrrrrrrry yummy. Definately most have next time anyone decides to stop by. \\n\\nBut all in all the verdict is you typical Chinese Take Out Place.\\n\\n*puts the menu on the fridge*",
          "Note: Tasty has a credit card minimum of $10 and has a parking lot\\n\\nTasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good, especially considering the price. Before I continue, I will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(As was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(I assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  However, I will chalk some of it up to my mistake because I thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. So, Tasty, you get a pass on the rice\\n\\nAnyhow, I ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(I've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). I ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. Also, the tofu was in very large chunks, which has seemed to be my luck lately. I want surface area, and I don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. I will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.\\n\\nThe eggroll, as I said, was tough.. It tasted good, but it was tough, and small... This probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum I do need to order something else with my tofu... I hope the soup is good.\\n\\nThe lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when I ordered. Portion size was good, for the $10.44 it cost me, I'll definitely be able to make a lunch out of what is left.",
          "The pros:\\nYou get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS. \\nThey have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. \\n\\n\\nThe cons:\\nThe woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. \\nMy pork dumplings were \\\"fried\\\" only on one side and were raw in the middle. \\nEverything was pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. \\nLeftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! \\n\\nIf you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout.",
          "Yep, closed!  My dad and I were gonna come here dinner last night.  He called me and told me to meet him at China Palace instead.  \\n\\nSo long Jummy Tsang's!  You were one of the last of the old time Chinese joints.",
          "This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. \\n\\nThey were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this is an \\\"Asian Bistro.\\\"",
          "This is an average Chinese buffet. The food was not bad, but not impressive neither, plus some cheap American food. The food was a little too greasy even by American Chinese food standard, and my stomach complained soon after I left that place. To me, that's a no-go signal.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps the food would be better there.",
          "I'm not a mean reviewer, if you look at the other places I've reviewed, but this was just so so so disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin was very poorly done. The meat was extremely bland, with very little seasoning. I have a very low sodium tolerance and yet I still found this fish to be made too bland. The rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as I took my first bite. I talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. It wasn't the same. The whole dish was a fail and I don't think I am ever coming back again :(",
          "Food: There are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores, but the food is only so-so.  We've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  The general Tso's tofu and the Moo Shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  The eggplant was soggy and not great.  The portions are large.  Nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.\\n\\nPrice: Tasty is cheap.  \\n\\nDrinks: N/A\\n\\nAtmosphere: Typical Chinese takeout place.  A photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  Located in the plaza next to Pizza Parma.  Decent location for that end of Shadyside.\\n\\nService: The employees speak poor English but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  The food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.\\n\\n(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly\\n\\n(-): food is nothing to write home about\\n\\nWould I go back again? If I'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else.",
          "Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.\\n\\nSo... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\\n\\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \\\"pork\\\"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\\n\\nNext came my \\\"lunch-portion\\\" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \\n\\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. \\n\\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\\n\\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\\n\\nI've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \\\"lunch-portion\\\" cost was $9.95.\\n\\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\\n\\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.",
          "Jimmy Tsang's Chinese Restaurant is one of the old \\\"traditional\\\" Pittsburgh restaurants, a place you remember as always \\\"being there.\\\"  My parents feel the same way about it.  It is a good, if unspectacular place with reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, Chinese flank steak, and authentic eggrolls.  \\n\\nI don't normally go for the spicy fare, indeed I prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables, but they have one item on the menu that I've always wanted to try--Sau La Gi, which is stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts.  Perhaps I've never noticed, but I don't recall seeing it anywhere else.  It was good, but Hoo-Boy did I have to pace myself while eating it.  And have plenty of water nearby!  Sau La Gi was worth trying once, but it really wasn't to my tastes and I doubt I'll have it again.\\n\\nMy friend Maryann tried  Ching Za Gai (spicy also) which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce.  I sampled it and perhaps I will order that for myself next time.  I'd like to cook a milder version of it myself at home.  \\n\\nMore to my tastes however are the Garden Chicken, Chicken with Broccoli, or Beef with Pea Pods.  Seafood dishes include Sweet and Sour Shrimp and  Sauteed Shrimp Szechaun Style.  Yeah, I'm a little unimaginative when it comes to Chinese food, but I know what I like and if a place can do the basics right, it's okay in my book!\\n\\nJimmy Tsang's also has a convenient and inexpensive lunch menu.  The place also does Korean Barbecue and you can book a private dining room for you and your special someone with a $100 deposit.",
          "This is the fourth Changs I've eat ate. It was pretty good. The food was kinda like it had been previously frozen. Had a strange texture. Some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken. Overall still pretty good. Would eat at this one again.",
          "The food here is good but it is not exceptional. \\n\\n I've been to this restaurant occasionally for a couple years and the menu hasn't changed at all. There is the typical Asian fare such as General Tso's, fried rice, noodles, stuffed shrimp and dumplings. There is also American macaroni and cheese, home fries and ham. \\n\\nWhen I go to China Garden, I always request a carry out container as I find it nauseating to sit in the dining area and see other patrons pile their plates with astonishing heaps of food. One thing for sure is that China Garden gets plenty of customers.\\n\\nDefinitely come here for a reasonably priced buffet!",
          "We visitied PF Changs on Sunday with a large group of 20 people.  Although they had to split the tables - everything was delicious!\\n\\nWe enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wraps...to the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the guests...to the fried banana dessert!\\n\\nif you are with a group, and you want dessert - get the fried bananas!  They come wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and with coconut/pineapple ice cream.\\n\\nOverall, we had a great time and would come back here again.",
          "Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?",
          "This place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall Chinese restaurant. There's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out and the service is rude. I decided to give Tasty a try because it's conveniently located on Highland Avenue and has easy parking.\\n\\nI ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Crab Rangoon. Sadly, they prepared Kung Pao Beef instead. It's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. It's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. While it wasn't what I ordered, the food was good...but there is better Chinese food out there.",
          "3/6/12  visit -  i am from san francisco bay area and if u want a dive go to china town in san francisco. - this place was dirty like chinatown dive but some of the best food i have every tasted came from a dive. the food was really good and my group ordered a bunch of different things it was all good- a- taste.- prices are reasonable a-. --------they dont speak english very good and got my order wrong.\\nsweet potatoe fries a+\\npizza  - a\\neggplant hoagie b+\\ngreek salad b+\\ngyro a+\\nif they scrubbed the place down and the lady spoke better english 4 star ****",
          "Far away from real Chinese food. Doesn't even taste good as American style Chinese food.",
          "So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. \\n\\nWe came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food.",
          "I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. \\n\\nThe last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \\n\\nAs for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \\n\\nThe workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking.",
          "Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.",
          "The worse \\\"Chinese food\\\", even the white rice which came with the ogle sweet and sour chicken is really bad.  Please don't eat this food.",
          "Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff, with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat.  You will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish, but it is delicious.",
          "I was unimpressed with my food and I am even more sad to see, now that P.F Chang's mass produces frozen dinners. \\nThis is about as far away from Chinese food you can get, unless of course you are eating microwaved warmed shrimp fried rice. The restaurant is cluttered and the music was up so loud.  I had to yell to carry on a conversation. P.F Chang's in the Waterfront is a unmemorable experience. Maybe I would have better luck microwaving my own meal at home?",
          "I've had PF Changs both in Pgh and KC and honestly, I'm never been disappointed nor elated with the food. It's 'upscale' Ameri-Chinese food. You don't come here seeking 'authentic' Asian staples; it's all changed to some degree to suit American taste buds... nothing wrong with that, imo. Do I even know what 'authentic' Chinese food is? Yes, sortuv, somewhat. Will I stop putting quotes around 'everything'? Definitely not!\\n\\nIt was 45 min from closing time when we (party of 6) rushed in on a weeknight; got seated, ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff.\\n\\nThis particular PF Changs, on the Homestead Waterfront, had fast and friendly service, though he forgot our order of asparagus. We sampled everything from the the Szechuan shrimp to the Mongolian beef to the Dan Dan Noodles. Good flavors, nothing that stepped out in the crowd.\\n\\nI don't come here all that often but when I do, I invariably leave feeling satisfied and full.",

          "This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \\n\\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \\n\\nThey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \\\"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\\\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \\n\\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \\\"main drag\\\" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.",

Baked goods did not look too great but that is not why I came here. Atmosphere is very mellow and comfortable. Also has Wifi which works! Nice to find a place like this when traveling. Is in the middle of a residential area and there doesnt seem to be anything else around here.",
          "The coffee was ok, but the service and ambiance left much to be desired. The place was dirty, with straw wrappers etc on the floor. The light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy. There were four people on staff but it took at least 2 minutes for one of them to stop gossiping with the others and take our order.  I got the feeling that this place has had a lot of success and the owners have let things slide. It was ok, but in looking for a coffee shop to make my regular hangout, I would not go back.",
          "Great variety of coffee and methods (press, Chemex, pour-over).  I did not get a chance to try to the espresso, but it looked very good as well. Verve and Olympia are two very solid roasters and provide a wealth of choices. \\n\\nStaff was very helpful, location great. All around a good place in Pittsburgh.",
          "I live close by so I go here frequently pretty much for the free WIFI and espresso. But here's a secret - they don't seem to know what an Americano is so often I am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request. Needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled. Although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste. Pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful. There is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta. Outside seating and people watching is always a good distraction plus there are all kinds of people who frequent this Panera from the very very old and decrepit to the fashionistas taking a break from Victoria Secrets, Ulta, Wet Seal and the other various shops at this water front location.",
          "I think the lattes have improved since my last review and their soy cappuccinos are the best I've ever had, in fact, I never even cared for them until trying Tazza D'oro's. I still hold their teas in high regard. However, the food here sucks. They've always had a limited sandwich menu, but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices. I am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich, especially in combination with caffeine. Even though Enrico's is an easy walk from my home, I find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. I guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews, but I don't think it's that hard to do both; I mean the staff seems highly competent, they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn. With a new lunch joint in the 'hood (Park Bruges), why not expand lunch options rather than downgrade to the point of forfeiting without even the slightest struggle?",
          "Maybe Tazza D'Oro doesn't need another review, but I guess it never hurts to lend your voice to the chorus of those praising a good, solid and well-run local business.  \\n\\nThe coffee selection is terrific.  The baristas are professional and courteous.  No, they are not chatty, but they are polite and friendly.  I'm not there for conversation, but for good coffee.  And that's what you get.  \\n\\nThe pastries and snacks are fine.  Good variety.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is JUST what I want when I need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet, comfortable and calming.  \\n\\nWhen it first opened (how long ago how?) it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (I live in Highland Park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at \\\"others\\\" who stopped by.   They've either relaxed or found other obsessions.  The clientele is, as folks said, eclectic and invigorating.  \\n\\nIt's become our after-dinner spot after a meal at Park Bruges or Smiling Banana Leaf, too!",
          "This is where I learned what good espresso tastes like. If you make it to Highland Park, stop there and get some great neighborhood atmosphere.",
          "I love tazza.. Their coffees are excellent and its a great place to enjoy a relaxing evening..I also like their Baklawa, sandwiches and Brownies..",
          "Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy.",
          "Reasons:\\n\\n1. LOCATION and setting: Highland Park is simply lovely - makes you feel as if you are in a small English town, where time has stood still. The art and small tables inside and outside are charming.\\n2. Socially Responsible:Fair trade and international array of coffee.\\n3. Fresh Meat:  Local pasture raised meat/ local produce in their tasty panini's.\\n4. Nice crowd and staff.",
          "I adore this place! The light green walls are serene, the chairs and tables are comfortable, and I love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! The coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (I'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) If a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, I'll be a fan for life. The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California. I count Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle Coffee as some of my favorite places, so I mean it when I say the coffee here is wonderful. Try it out, you won't be let down.",
          "I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area.",
          "As far as Starbucks go, this is a pretty nice one.  The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\n\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\n\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\n\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.",
          "This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!\\n\\nSeating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.\\n\\nBaristas are friendly and fast.",
          "Mmm...peppermint mocha\\n\\nIn my quest to visit every Starbucks in the USA I have stopped at yet another location.  This one is located in the center of a circle road -- very cache and in a newer part of the area.",
          "The coffee here is amazing (I love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). The baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. While there are a number of tables, Enrico's was busy even on a Friday night...I would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours.",
          "Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.\\n\\nThe coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.\\n\\nIn addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.\\n\\nAll that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.",
          "I just realized they remodeled this one recently-ish. Well, in my world recently because it's been a while since I've been here.\\n\\nThey've added more seating which makes it way more conducive to having a meeting here. Which is my concern during the week. I imagine during the weekend it just fills up with tweens getting their sugar rush before hitting the movie theater. \\n\\nThe coffee, or tea for me.. Is still same old same old. I don't imagine one single Starbucks will break the mold and make original drinks...",
          "Still one of the best places to get soy capps, but they no longer have an extensive tea list. What's left is not a bad selection, but there are dramatically less choices, so it's no longer where I would go to sample new varieties of tea. Sandwich menu is even more severely limited and it seems that pretty much all the food is provided by U.S. Foods, or the like; nothing is local. It'd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally. Until then, it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso, with nice vibes and pleasant service.",
          "We ordered a double espresso which looked more like a single shot. Cozy coffeeshop with an ample amount of seating.\\n\\nThere were different types of coffee available for purchase to drink there and beans to take home.\\n\\nCute neighborhood coffeeshop type feel.",
          "This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea, coffee, snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. I used to frequent this place much more when I lived in Pittsburgh, but I still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. It is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  The staff is great and the prices are reasonable, too. The only change I could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. It'd make the vibe a little more comfortable!",
          "I've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and I'm sorry, but I don't wholly agree with, well, everyone else; so, here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe.  I'm aware, like many reviewers on this site, that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still, there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.  But the place itself was a turn off, despite the interesting people that it attracts.  Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.  I think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park, but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive.",
          "Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful",
          "It's good when they are on, but they are so inconsistent you never know what you are going to get.  The coffee machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in the last century which is off putting.  Generally, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are in the neighborhood and desperately hungry--you MIGHT catch a lucky break and be there on a good day.",
          "If there was ever a \\\"get your coffee and go\\\" Starbucks, this is it. Right in the center of the Waterfront, this Starbucks has no sofa, comfy chairs, only table seating. I love the baristas here, But I don't like the location of the building.",
          "This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them.",
          "I'll preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that 3 stars is a good review for me--it means it's good, but I'm not going to go out of my way for it.  \\n\\nEnrico's Tazza D'oro Cafe is definitely very good--I love the location in Highland Park, and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic.  We even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin I would say the ones they had looked good.  I do wish they had more outdoor seating, though.  It's tough to make the \\\"I'm a fan\\\" list for coffee houses.  I'll try it again and may change my review in the future.  \\n\\nWhile I\\\"m on the note of Highland Park, I want to join the chorus of people who are dismayed by the recent hit and run involving the two bikers in Highland Park.  Accidents (no matter how horrible) do happen, and as such I'm not as angry about the actual accident;  but to just drive away and leave people severely injured by the side of the road is pretty wretched behavior.  At this point, i only hope that if you are the person who did this, you will at least dedicate the rest of your life to doing good to balance your to-date lousy behavior.\\n\\nIt's never too late.",

Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there.  The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired.  Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby.  Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush.  We will not be back.  Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card?????  Please get up with the times.",
          "Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey.",
          "Dave and Buster's is an enigma, is it dining, a bar, or  playground for video game lovers? Let me get the bar part out of the way first, it's overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. \\n\\nNext, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. \\n\\nThe games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.\\n\\nOverall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century.",
          "This place just plain sucks\\nBad management lost them biz\\nDumb arcade drama*\\n\\n* they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old",
          "ehh, 3.5 -- I can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. \\n\\nI'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\\n\\nThe food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)\\n\\nDrinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \\n\\nThe prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \\\"cost\\\" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.\\n\\nOverall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. \\n\\nI can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.",
          "Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff.",
          "When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \\nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \\nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \\nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.",
          "This club is now officially closed for good due to redevelopment in the area.",
          "DAVE & BUSTERS!  It's a nice place to eat, have fun and drink!!  All ages can enjoy this place.  I was so EXCITED to hear them announce that after 10p, all children whether accompanied by a guardian or not had to go!  It made for a nice evening for adults only.  \\n\\nEverytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves.  I didn't give it FOUR STARS because every time I've went I haven't been able to eat in the restaurant area of there.  I know I still get the same food that everyone else does wherever you sit.  Sometimes, I like the nice relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant.  I haven't as of yet, been seated there.  \\n\\nNot to mention that the servers around the bar, are a little slow at responding to customers as well.  So all in all, D&B's is a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment.  Just don't expect to be seated in the restaurant portion, and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area.",
          "Sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos.  On the one hand, there are plenty of waterslides/pools that are a good fit for young \\\"riders\\\", on the other hand, Sandcastle, like any city amusement park, attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood.  \\n\\nUnfortunately that element doesn't particularly care about \\\"censoring\\\" speech for 9 year old ears, and worse, in the Mon Tsunami, about personal space, since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and 'showing off' for the fairer sex, and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.\\n\\nHaving said that, it's still a good day at the park. . . cheese fries, a cool dip in the pool on a hot day, some fun slides. . . \\n\\nI think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park.  It is NOT policed particularly effectively.  if you take small children you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings, paying attention to the group of 17 somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity, \\\"accidentally\\\" bumping into people for a reaction from their group.  \\n\\nMOSTLY it's a good time.  Mostly.",
          "I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \\\"games\\\", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.",
          "went in as a guest of a friend of mine who is a member there... nice atmosphere.  LOT of oldddd folks and they seem to market themselves as \\\"Silver Fitness\\\" sort of fitness center... (this may be a turn-off for some younger people.)\\nthey had a lot of machines and exercise gear ... 2 pools and tan beds/etc /etc.  \\ni'd probably prefer personally to work out somewhere with a younger crowd.",
          "I love the games here but can't go very often since they don't rotate new games in very often.  The place is usually pretty clean.\\n\\nPool tables often have a wait on the weekend but are some of the better ones you'll find in the city.\\n\\nFood is just \\\"ok\\\" Drink prices are fair but not great.",
          "The staff here is very nice and the set up has TVs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sports, the music is nice and pretty mellow and the place is very spacey and the prices are pretty reasonable. And most importantly is the place seems to be kept clean at all times.",
          "First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to!",
          "Not much of a review for this one, but just a few tidbits of info...\\n\\nPool (on Friday/Saturday) is $14 per hour\\n(I'm pretty sure its $10 through the week)\\n\\nMixed drinks are way too pricey for the location.\\nThe food is crap.\\n\\nThe games are fun and the pool tables are nice (they're the big tournament style/size, not the shitty bar-room, tiny pool tables).\\n\\nThat is all.  :)\\n\\n(the pricing is based on my recent trip.\\nWe shot pool for a few hours, I had a bar tab (that wasn't out of control) and my night ended up costing me $60",
          "D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.\\n\\nYou pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).\\n\\nWaitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.\\n\\nThe games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.\\n\\nNot a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant.",
          "My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. This place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. All of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. When our food came though, everything was below average. They have a huge selection of games for the kids to play, but you pay dearly to play games here. The food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced.",
          "This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.\\n\\nWalking into such a huge space, especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.\\n\\nUn-nerving actually. \\n\\nBecause Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.\\n\\nAs far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.\\n\\nBut most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.\\n\\nAnd while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.\\n\\nEspecially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball. And proceeded to dominate.\\n\\nTrust.",
          "A fun place and lots to do but a bit pricy. $20.00 will buy you a hundred points which will last you a little over an hour.I recommend the bowling game ,ball racing car game and connect 4 also there are several games that can be played in groups of 4",
          "I'll have a biased opinion of any place like this. What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \\\"donate\\\" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. \\nIn regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I've gone I've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!). Either way, it's a really fun place that you'll most certainly have a good time at.",

          "I was in need of a pedicure before my beach vacation, so I decided to stop in to Star Nails in Bellevue. I've never had a pedicure before, mostly because I'm super-ticklish, but I felt like it was about time.\\n\\nThe salon looks quite nice inside; wood (well, laminate) floors, clean decor, and four pedicure chairs up on the platform on the right. I didn't have an appointment, and waited about ten minutes on a Wednesday evening.\\n\\nNancy was my nail technician, and she greeted me warmly and helped me over into the pedicure area. Pro tip: Don't wear a past-knee-length skirt, as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward. Nancy helped me out like a pro and I was all set.\\n\\nThe pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the Migun massage tables. They don't just vibrate; they knead. The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. The foot bath was nice and warm. I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.\\n\\nNancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.\\n\\nThis is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.\\nEND TMI\\n\\nEven though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. Polish on and all done! At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.\\n\\nThe manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.\\n\\nThe polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.\\n\\nAgain, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.\\n\\nThey also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art. I'm not sure if they do waxing. I am sure that it's a friendly place, that it's clean (important!), and that they made me feel relaxed even though I was beyond nervous going in.",
          "Got my hair done in an updo (for only $25!!!!)  yesterday for my wedding.  they did amazing!  they listened to what i wanted and although it took quite a while (i have really long hair) she spent the time to do it right and exactly how i wanted it.  great service!!   The price is not high but the quality is!",
          "STAY AWAY, the owners are so rude, they blatantly say they are not doing well and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in Pittsburgh. they make you feel so unwelcome, advertise they offer a bunch of services and then when you ask they snap at you that they only do hair.  it was so awkward and weird .  i received warnings not to get my hair done there so i was going to get a pedicure because i had a gift certificate.  she told me her employees will only take cash if they have to touch a client's feet.  I may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate, but this place gives me the creeps, sounds dirty, and has beyond bad customer service.  They definitely do NOT know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well. Sue and Kristi pass the phone back and forth because noone wants to take a call.  she reiterates that the business is doing bad and they need more clients.  i have never experienced a ruder salon, or should i say dead beat shack.",
          "Let me just tell you, I have really, really difficult hair.  type 3b Naturally curly, 100% grey, I dye it dark and mess with the color myself. ( never good)  If you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair. Since I have been going to Mane Attractions I have really LOVED my hair. I have been going there for about 4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet. ( you curly girls know what I am talking about). I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed. The only complaint I ever have is that yes, sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week. I just know to call and schedule things. it is a small business and I get it.  P.S. kids haircuts are only 10$ and My daughter loves it.",
          "Now I'm picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.\\n\\nI had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be \\\"difficult\\\" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to \\\"Locks of Love,\\\" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.\\n\\nI watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it \\\"wasn't looking right.\\\"  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.\\n\\nAt that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, \\\"I have to leave, so sorry \\\"as I bolted for the door.",
          "Nothing spectacular, but I go there regularly, and generally get a cut that works fine for at least a couple of months.  They did a good job after I had a botched cut overseas (hairdressers in Japan are, understandably, not necessarily qualified to work on non-Asian hair, as they don't cut a lot of it). Parking can be tough, depending on time of day--there's a shared private lot, but it's small.",
          "They made my Portuguese Water Dog look horrible. \\n\\nThey actually sheared all the fur from my dog claiming that it was matted and therefore they had no choice. This isn't true as I personally brush my dog every morning. When I complained, the owner said: \\\"But we did tell you that we will cut the dog's fur short.\\\"  Yes, they did, and I thought that considering that the days are hot in August, they are proposing a little cooler grooming. I never expected them to just shear the dog to the skin. \\nI think they did it because they are hopelessly irresponsible. Although they charged $70 for this brutally simple operation they have not even trimmed dog's ears and tail. Consequently, the dog has disproportionally long hair on its tail and the ears. \\nI used Animal Elegance for more than a decade. Long before current management took over. Over all these years I sometimes took in stride their accessional compromise of standards and always paid their exorbitant prices without complaint. However, this fragrant negligence, combined with their total disregard of the fact that I was an old and loyal customer did it. I will avoid this place from now on and would like to suggest that you do the same.",
          "i'm not sure why this place has bad reviews. its par for thecourse for supercuts. standard cut 16.95 is a bit pricy but they always do exactly what I say. i've simple hair so it works well for me. employees are generally nice, sometimes like talking to me sometimes talk just to each other, worth three stars for sure.",
          "I went there today! The cut was terrible! I have an awful experience. They lady that cut my hair was nice but she wanted to leave early so she made a disaster in my head!",
          "Went here with a friend for his haircut. It's been a long time since I've been to a barber shop or haircut salon/store, but from what I remember this place seems completely average. The hair stylists seem nice enough and competent. The wait was a few minutes- I actually expected the wait to be longer because we came in on a Saturday. If I ever need a haircut (which I haven't gotten in maybe 5 years!), I wouldn't have a problem stopping in here- but I tend to enjoy my long shaggy mop.....",
          "Animal Elegance is not much on the outside but the owner was very nice & LISTENED to how I wanted my teacup poodle groomed and used the products that I requested.\\nI was very happy with my services and I will return. \\n My poodles groom was $50,including tip, which I think is very reasonable.",
          "I had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer. My dog  was not groomed to my specifications; infact she was butchered. I went to the trouble of taking a photo of my dog with  the haircut that I wanted, as well as speaking with the woman who assured me she would be grooming my dog. The owner groomed my dog, not the woman that I spoke with and she looked nothing like my dog when I picked her up. The owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service. Do not take your dog there to be groomed!",
          "Waiting 20 minutes to get one piece of wood cut in an empty store on a Friday afternoon.  Priceless!",
          "I wish I could return a haircut.\\n\\nUnfortunately Kelly, Melissa, and Jen were not there so I settled for whoever was free at the time. \\n\\nWorst trim of my life:\\nshe cut off over an inch more than just the dead/split ends\\nshe did not cut the hair how I described initially\\nshe did not change the cut to how I repeated during the cut when I noticed she was cutting it straight across instead of curving it in the back, which does NOT mix well with my curly hair\\nafter retelling her how I wanted it cut, she compared this tragedy to deaths of family/friends and how I should get over it\\nthe beautiful long layers I had and wanted again are now choppy, medium layers\\nmy left side is even choppier than the right side of my hair\\nI fear straightening my hair to make this unevenness less evident\\n\\nI regret tipping her because I understand how the service industry works because my minimum tip of 20% for all service people is undeserved for her lack of work.\\n\\nI want everyone to know how the only good hair stylists there are Kelly (who moved to Philly), Melissa and Jen. If they are not available, do NOT risk going.\\n\\nAlso, the Supercuts Oakland location is horrible at waxing eyebrows unless you are lucky to get the only woman of color there.\\n\\nWhile it was a $20 cut (after the 20% tip), I know had to buy biotin to grow my hair faster so it is more expensive to me in the end. I hope this proves helpful to all perspective customers!",
          "I got a pedicure here. Not bad, they were pretty thorough. But two days later both of my big toes were infected and oozing pus where she trimmed my toenails on the sides (which was weird anyway). I hate to rate a local shop down, but man my toes hurt.",
          "My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time.",
          "Figure I'd give Supercuts a shot since Giant Eagle sells their gift cards so it is great for fuelperks.  I don't remember her name but she is one of the \\\"bigger\\\" woman there.  I wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy.  So I asked her for a trim to get the sides/back cleaned up.  She said ok and off she goes.  5 minutes later, we were done.   Yes, just like a bad date, we were done in 5 minutes.\\n\\nI got home, showered, and saw the damage.  It was messy.  What's worst is every day it grows, it looked even worst.\\n\\nI'll just stick to my usual barber.",

          "I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.",
          "The worst dental office I ever been. No one can beat it!!! You should avoid it at any time.",
          "In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.\\n\\nWhen I look at Yelp reviews, I usually weed out the outliers (the best and the worst).   Unfortunately, there are only two reviews.\\n\\nIt was my first time at the office.   The office admin (very nice) asked for me to come early (before 9am) to complete paperwork.   I arrived at 8:50.    I waited.   I watched 2 employees walk by me (unlocked the door and re-locked it).    They did not acknowledge me.\\n\\nThe door I was at had signage (open hours).    I decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.\\n\\nThe office admin (very nice) called me to inform I am missing my appointment.   I explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.\\n\\nI recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.\\n\\nPoor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review.",
          "Dr. Eric Segal was a complete ass. He was rude and obnoxious to me and my wife. We went to him for an adjustment and I left wanting to adjust this idiot's face. I will deter all of my clients from going here and will personally make sure that this man doesn't disrespect anyone else like he did to us.",
          "Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.",
          "It was my first time here.  Was recommended by my coworker.  However, I was a little unsure as I've read some bad reviews about this place.\\n\\nThe first visit was great.  The receptionists were helpful and gave me guidance on how to get my dog licensed.  Everyone seemed happy and talkative.  \\n\\nDr. Bezak was very nice.  He had a smile on him the entire time I was there.  He was very quick to give me information about anything and everything relating to the dog.  Overall, I had a good first visit and definitely going back.\\n\\nThe only thing that made it didn't earn a five-star is that my appointment is at 12:15pm.  The entire office have their lunch at 1pm.  So I can tell there was alot of hustle to get me out of their asap.  I don't mind that it was a quick visit, but I would have liked to had time to ask more questions.  If you want adequate time with the doc, consider making your appointment after their lunch.",
          "Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June.  He will be missed very much.  \\n\\nI think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!",
          "When I moved to the area, Dr. Weinberg was recommended to me by my cousin who had been a client for years. I've had nothing but positive experiences with her and her staff since seeing her two years ago. The team is professional, nice and courteous. I recently had to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they were very accommodating. My daughter looks forward to coming to the dentist so that's saying something. I DO wish they would turn off FOX news in the lobby as I'd rather watch paint dry but... nobody's perfect.",
          "dr. goldberg offers everything i look for in a general practitioner.  he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first.  really, what more do you need?  i'm sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank.",
          "Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I've had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor, terrible staff.  It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.",
          "I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice, but I doubt her ability. Every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired. The third and last issue I have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow I have received an invoice for $55. I called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so I gave up. Will never go back or refer anyone else",
          "I first found the Newman Chiropractic Center about 2 years ago when one day, my lower back pain got so severe I could barely walk. I called one or two other Chiropractic offices first and neither could see me that morning or even that same day. Dr. Novak at the Newman Chiropractic Center was able to see me immediately and since that day, I've never even thought about going anywhere else. Whenever I need an adjustment, I simply call ahead and let them know I'll be stopping in; they are extremely flexible and understanding of my busy schedule.\\n\\nI look forward to visiting the office for an adjustment because I know that when I leave, I will feel amazing. The office itself is not as posh as you might find other places in Shady Side but it's welcoming, comfortable, and certainly gets the job done. \\n\\nI have and will continue to highly recommend Dr. Novak to anyone who is need of Chiropractic care.",
          "By far the worst most unprofessional dentist I have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the TVs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from Hawaii and she had to stop 3 times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to Hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen I had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result I wouldn't recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone I hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain I had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after I called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled!!",
          "Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldberg is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come.",
          "THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \\\"dentist\\\" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \\\"you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\\\". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \\\"bone graft\\\". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \\\"dentist\\\" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers.",
          "Top notch doctor in a top notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. \\nIt is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great.",
          "I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \\n\\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!",
          "I've decided where I stand with Emmert Dental. They are unprofessional, rude and have no clue what they're doing (behind the desk). I will not be going back nor will I have nice things to say about them.",

          "Pros:\\n- At least there's a climbing gym in this area\\n- Walls get reset often\\n\\nCons:\\n- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. \\n- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: \\\"Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped.\\\" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly \\\"If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them.\\\" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. \\n- The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. \\n- The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while. \\n- The fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here.",

But that's not the gyms fault\\nOnly one flat bench press\\nSince they have pools and a kids activities some times kids wonder into the wight areas\\n\\nSo in the end more pros then cons.\\nThis is more just nit picking but as all gyms have them. There are a few weirdos who are members and just take up space more then workout but oh well what can ya do about it.",
          "This is not a review on this gym. It is a review on their customer/membership service. I just called there. All I wanted to know is what their monthly fees were. Simple right? Wrong. They want your name and phone number and the rights to your first born child and then they won't even tell you anything without you physically coming to them to \\\"talk\\\" about what's best for you. I took psychology classes, I know what they are trying to do by talking to you face to face. I am sorry, but I want a gym, not a drug dealer. I don't need you to try to shove your products down my throat, I want to go somewhere to work out and be left alone. (That's why I wear headphones and don't make eye contact). \\n\\nI just wish places like this would give you a straight answer about their membership fees without hassling you. I won't go here now, period, because I don't believe in these kind of tactics. Just be straight with people, is that so hard?",
          "I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!",
          "I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.  They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs.\\n\\nDreams crushed.  Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room.  I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.\\n\\nSo we bouldered.  The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another.  You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss.  With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.\\n\\nThe place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.  I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's).\\n\\nSide note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area.  Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully.\\n\\nI expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh.",
          "Very primitive bouldering area, but the routes were challenging, in part due to the lack of a smearable surface (plywood kinda painted to look like rocks),  mega shitty footholds (jibs worn down to shiny scummy nubs that sorely needed cleaning or replacing), and a distinct lack of fall-friendliness (one old mat to be shared among every 3 or 4 walls, and an unforgiving floor that thudded every time someone landed on it).  Not a bargain for a $12 day pass since the routes did not seem to have been changed very often and all climbs shared the same foot jibs which looked practically permanent. The changing room was literally a closet.\\n\\nAll that griping aside, there were some decent climbs. The V3's were fairly easy but the V3/V4's were exponentially harder. I was able to do one V4/V5, but my butt was royally kicked on everything else. No ego boosts here, and the masochist in me awards 3 stars to this old school climbing gym.",
          "There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was quite disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects.  \\n\\nFirst of all, the gym in pretty cheap.  And the bouldering area is really quite good.  To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area.  Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. \\n\\nIt seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent.  I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon.  The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. \\n\\n\\nNow the downsides.  The staff wasn't very helpful.  The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test.  It's poor form. \\n\\nThe ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull.  They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground.  I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. \\n\\nThe walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible.  Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned.  Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous.  \\n\\nThere's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean.  I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity.",
          "I've been climbing for a few years but have friends who have never climbed. This place has lots of climbs at all different levels so my friends and I can enjoy climbing here together.  Plus they have instructional classes if you want to learn more. It has a great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends or meet new people. The staff are amazing! Very nice and very helpful. The prices are very reasonable, lower than any other gym I have climbed in (and I have climbed in lots of facilities). I definitely recommend climbing here.",
          "I'm giving this the ok rating, I am not an experienced climber but a beginner. The last climb I went out was a real one in Utah with my brother who got me all harnessed up only to instruct me to place my foot and hand level with my head and pull myself up . You can imagine how that went with my golden retriever feverish barking and running below instructing my brother to let me down lol.\\n\\nSo for a beginner I found the price to be ok I went with a group and paid 16$ for shoe rental and I guess climbing fee? We stayed for about two hours. We went on a Saturday it was very crowded probably 15-30 people in the place but there are so many choices you can still get a wall. There were several beginner climbs that are easy for anyone with a shred of upper body strength. Then some V2 and V3 and V4, the other beginner gals I was climbing with found there was a pretty big variation from the VB to V2 on some of the climbs. So sometimes it was better just not to follow the stickers completely if you're a beginner but still looking for variation while bouldering. \\n\\nI think safety-wise things are bit of a liability here, walls are high, mats are very old and very few. Also lots of people don't follow the basic rules including teenagers who are there alone. So be cautious of your space an d others space and consider fatigue when getting to the top of those walls with your hands all sweaty. \\n\\nI also expected it to be a little larger based on the website photos, but I understand that this is Pittsburgh not a city with room for a huge gym like out west. I also think if they were to build a bigger newer gym here with higher climbs, then you would be looking at paying $25 and up. \\n\\nMy biggest complaint is that you can only do lessons at certain times with a harness, this makes it harder for beginners to get in and get a feel. I did complete one or two V7 or V8. Just to push myself but I would have had more fun if I had the support of a rope so the next time I go back I will consider classes. Which costs a little bit more but oh well. Class times are limited check the website.",
          "Pittsburgh doesn't really have its choice of indoor climbing walls, but I was pretty impressed by this location (though note, this review is just for bouldering). The bouldering area is huge, and on a Saturday afternoon surprisingly empty with no need to wait for any route. It's labeled from V0 upwards... although the floor is padded, the walls do go up pretty high (the 10ft estimate from before is accurate), so a fall would be pretty scary... they do give you an option to wear a helmet, but I saw nobody doing so.\\n\\nThe routes are all clearly marked, and difficulty seemed to correspond with rating - there are also a ton to choose from, so you won't get bored. One staff member in particular was amazing - Allen - who spent the time giving climbing tips and encouragement to whomever needed it. Costs are also reasonable ($12/day, + $3/shoes, $2/chalk), and it's located in a nice strip mall with the East End Co-Op nearby for food. Overall, not a bad place to spend an afternoon!",
          "The blonde woman who tuns the gym was extremely rude to us. First time we went she refused yo.get off the phone on a personal call to help us. Then she gave us the rules for the bouldering area in a rapid bored monotone. Compared to other climbing gyms I have gone to this gym is less safe (no gri-gris), unfriendly, and more expensive. Definitely not worth it. Worst customer service I've seen in a while.",
          "Some helpful hints for the Climbing Wall:\\n\\n-A one-day pass is $12.  College students/active military pay $10.  Wednesday is 1/2 price for ladies (but only after they pay full price on the first visit).  Wednesday is also 1/2 price for guys who wear a sports bra.  Yup, you heard me right.  Wednesdays are usually pretty crowded.\\n\\n-They run a different membership special every month.  If you climb more than once a week, a membership can definitely be worth it.\\n\\n-If it's your first time at the wall, I highly suggest just doing the \\\"bouldering certification\\\" instead of the \\\"safety and belay certification class.\\\"  The bouldering certification takes about 5 minutes and then you can start climbing.  Decide if you like it, then do the belay certification.\\n\\n-If you \\\"like\\\" them on facebook, you can get updates about when they change the routes, what membership specials they're running, if they're selling any old/used shoes for discounted prices, etc.  \\n\\nThe wall is in a great location, on several bus routes, and right next to the East End Food Co-op.  It can get crowded, but everyone takes turns so you have plenty of opportunities.",
          "If you like being greeted in the morning by a gym worker slopping down eggs from a frying pany instead of working....this is your gym....complain to the manager and she gets nasty....try getting in touch with the owner....impossible!  Most unprofessional gym ever!!!!",
          "I bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes. I was in my early sixties and hadn't exercised in a while. I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. Do they think that this is their private gym?",
          "As a new climber I found the whole process intimidating, but the staff at The Climbing Wall helped me get on the right path. Also, the regulars here seemed very nice and always willing to help out a newbie. It isn't very expensive either, 10 or 12 bucks for a full day of bouldering is a very reasonable deal (I haven't seen many places which were cheaper). \\n\\nI'm sure a lot of people, including myself, wish this place was a little bigger, but for being in the city it's not a bad size. It's actually surprising how many routes they managed to plan out for the size of the place, there's more than enough to keep the walls feeling fresh even after many climbs. The diversity of the routes is really great too, there's plenty of routes for each skill level and climbing style. \\n\\nThe overall experience was wonderful: great staff, great people, and a great setup. \\n\\nTip: If you're a beginner without your own equipment, the shoe rental is worth the extra 3 or 4 bucks.",

          "Smiley's is wonderful... filled with things to keep our trio of cats well-fed, well-treated, and well-entertained. Certainly this is not a big box store, but, honestly, I wouldn't give my pets 99% of the food, treats, or toys that can be found in those stores, so, really, Smiley's offers me a better selection of what I actually want than any big box does. (They have a very good selection of toys for cats!)  And Smiley's takes bulk orders and has the food within a few days... saving us the trouble of schlepping out to the 'burbs.",
          "I moved to PGH about 3 years ago with my cat and was nervous about finding a new vet. My previous vet in NY was just wonderful and I was doubtful that I would find another as good or as caring as her. Over the past 3 years I have taken my cat there not only for his yearly's but for other heatlth issues and was alway met with caring staff. Dr. Simard is my favorite vet there, and I try to get her as often as I can, but I have also seen Dr. Berger who is great and have heard good things about Dr. Schroth as well. Dr. Gerson is the owner, I have seen him once and he is a tad gruff, but if you are direct with him he is easy to work with. \\nMy cat has always had a bit of a weight issue and since going to Point Breeze and working with Dr. Simard my cat has gone from 25 lbs to 18lbs and we seem to be well on the way to Dr. Simards goal of 16lbs. \\nMy cat was also treated by Dr. Simard for a bad case of worms, after apparently catching and consuming a mouse in our basement - again they got me in right away and before I knew it he was worm-free. \\nI have never felt like they wanted to up-sell me on anything, and they have always been very patient and willing to hear my concerns. \\nI really love this clinic, and truely believe that they exceed in animal care.",
          "Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\\n\\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\\n\\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\\n\\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. \\n\\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?\\n\\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\\n\\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. \\n\\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\\n\\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter!",
          "I took my cat here for a preliminary checkup after adopting her from the animal shelter & then again to have her declawed. I was very impressed by the facilities and service. The facilities are spotless & modern, and the vets seem both knowledgeable and willing to spend time with you and your animal.\\n\\nI was particularly impressed when I had my cat declawed. They kept her for several days to monitor my progress & called me each day to update me on her progress.\\n\\nIt seems a bit expensive (although I have no other point of comparison) but the service is well worth it.",
          "I have an almost three-year-old cat named Jack that I spoil as if he were my son. I honestly never experienced the love for and from an animal until I adopted Jack from an Animal Rescue League. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\\n\\nThe shelter is great and I'll probably get another cat in the near future. Check this location out!",
          "That is a great cat they have working, but they only have 3 brands of cat food, all of them expensive.  Funny enough though not as expensive as what I was looking for.  They followed me around like I was going to stuff my pockets and that just ruined the whole mom and pop thing.",
          "I'm a crazy cat lady and proud of it! \\n\\nBeing a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels.  It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. \\n\\nNow I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for \\\"cat cuddling.\\\"  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. \\n\\nThe other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. \\n\\nI would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!  \\n\\nJust check it out if you're curious.  You won't regret it!  Your new furry friends will appreciate it as well!",
          "The vet met with us for a very short amount of time. She was rushed, seemed distracted, and was abrupt. She very quickly said that it seemed like SCC, or oral cancer, and that there was no cure and the prognosis wasn't good. She left the room seconds after and only came back in to say that they would get blood work and schedule a biopsy. After she said she thought it was SCC, she didn't give us a chance to ask questions or respond. \\n\\nThe technician didn't have any demeanor with our cat, nor with us as clients. She seemed tired, and overworked.\\n\\nAll in all, this was a negative experience. I recommend that you take your pets to another vet :(",
          "Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. \\\"Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\\\" she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course. \\\"Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.\\\" After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier. \\\"I'll bring your carrier back out in a minute.\\\" We said no, that's okay, keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no \\\"Would you like a moment before I take him?\\\" No \\\"I'm sorry.\\\" Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit. \\n\\nThey get a couple stars for offering a necessary service. But other than that, this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy.",

          "I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring.  During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me.  Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.  A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter).  I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.  The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing.  In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.  Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.\\n\\nI would highy suggest adopting from this shelter.  I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok.  The shetler staff care deeply about the animal AND the human's well-being!",
          "The problem I have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted 3 minutes.

The vet didn't mentioned it during the \\\"exam\\\" other than telling me to buy a finger brush to brush his teeth.\\n\\nI was primarily there for a vaccination shot but if they're going to charge me for a examination, they should do a proper examination.  I just felt I was rushed out of there. \\n\\nI took my dog to another vet where they told me about the slab fracture, gave me info on how it usually happens, potential problems that it can cause, and recommendations on ways to fix the problem.",

          "It's okay. Food is cheap but portions are small. For example I order the chicken tenders, and I got 3 little tiny tenders, and a decent amount of fries. Also the restaurant is not really clean either.  This restaurant is not my number 1 choice.",

          "Steak 'n Shake's food is pretty good and the prices aren't bad for the quantity of food. I ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing. The salad looked thrown together and was $5.49 for 2 croutons, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and chicken breast. (They forgot the cheese!) The staff wasn't very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didn't want to be there. There usually is a long wait at Steak 'n Shake, but if you catch them when they aren't busy, you will breeze through- drive-thru that is. I do like their food and you can eat healthy options, but the staff isn't helpful and the quality isn't always there.",
          "Burgers are not the best quality. Better than McDonald's but not much better. The fries are fairly thin, but crispy. They aren't bad. The prices are also quite decent. However, their shakes are amazing. Thick and creamy. It's also great that they have half off shakes on weekdays in the early morning like 1-3am.",
          "Went to Rock Bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. My coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. If you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's - the filling tasted like that and I am a big fan! \\n\\nMondays are half off burger days and I tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. It was delish! The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. \\n\\nThe prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it's totally worth it. I think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down. \\n\\nI felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. The service was quick and I think you can get in and out in under an hour.",

Your mea l(of veggies, tofu and kale) could end up costing $20 easily.  I usually grab a hot meal and play on my computer 1-2 hours.  Love the carrott juice with ginger YUM!  A small is $4.30 ouch!  Just found out they won't charge you for bags if you bring your own....COOL!",

I've had pretty good experiences inside, it's usually the drive-thru where things fall a part.  \\n\\nIt's the rare place I can get a Frisco Melt well, the ONLY place I can get a Frisco Melt!  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk, Walk In OR Drive Thru.\\n\\nJust take a gun on Weekends, you'll be fine.",
          "Food is good, what you'd expect from Steak n Shake. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. so incredibly awful. expect to take at least an hour for your meal, even when it's slow. I've been going here for years when I want a cheap meal, but the service is so so so awful. Go to McDonalds.",
          "I really like the chili. Burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. Pretty hard to mess up a side salad. As others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. Store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. The staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. All in all what you pay is what you get. Cheap and crap service.",
          "This review is for the buffet at Whole Foods. Overall, it is good, and there are lots of great options. The food seems fresh and it is a good place to get a quick, healthy lunch on-the-go. I went with a friend and we spent a little over $20 on lunch for the 2 of us, which seems a little high for what it is, but I think we must have just gotten a lot of food because $7.99/lb is fair. Plus it is hard to get lunch for any less than that these days without eating fast food.",

Keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.\\n\\nLong story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out. Now I see that others on Yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. Wish I had looked it up earlier.",
          "My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!\\nThe cashier took my friends's order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for \\\"serving off their orders\\\" when they didn't have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn't make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\\nI've eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I've worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead!",
          "This place has the worst service I've ever seen. I called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins. When I got to the counter, the lady working rudely told me to wait for my name to be called because she didn't have my ticket to ring up the order. Um, okay...then walk over and get it so i can pay for it! So I waited and waited as people who came in long after me got their orders. The \\\"workers\\\" just stand around and spend more time talking to the regulars and trying to act like they are a big deal. I had to leave without my order after 40 minutes. DO NOT GO HERE!",

We just started a new batch.\\\"\\n\\nLeft with:  Big mac, medium fries, no coke.\\n\\nActually, now that I think about it, this was one of my better experiences there...",

          "Wahhhhh!!!! They're remodeling this one and it's frustrating! I swear I don't mind change. I really don't~  I should have seen this coming.  There were telltale signs of this happening. First, they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct Iggle video was. That's A-ok with me, I didn't use the pharmacy anyway. \\n\\nBut THEN, THEN they moved the whole toiletries section over there. They put my spaghetti and \\\"ethnic food\\\" section (by the way, I love that ethnic food includes spaghetti) to where my Tylenol was. My kitty food is now where my spaghetti once was. Can you tell how exasperated I'm getting?? \\n\\nDid I mention I don't mind change? But here's the thing, I really hate grocery shopping. It's kinda sorta my own fault because I must read every label to make sure I'm not eating something with 25 grams of fat and 5000 calories (even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time.) So going to this Giant Eagle frequently was nice because I KNEW WERE EVERYTHING WAS. Now I don't....wahhh! \\n\\nOk, I'll stop crying. I know I'll eventually be back. I'm sure (??) it will be an even better more magical grocery shopping experience once they're done. But I can't take it for right now. I'll be forced to shop at the Ghetto Bird down in the Southside until my former #1 store is all shiny and new again.",

I complain, too bad...they have to comeTHREE times before replacing it!  NEVER AGAIN.",
          "I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. \\n\\nWhenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. \\n\\nToday was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,\\\"Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!\\\" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.\\n\\nThere are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!\\n\\nI'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!",
          "My orders have come out bad pretty much every time I have ordered from here. The chicken nuggets come out under par. I'm lucky if the fries come out right. My last experience is the last straw. I recently posted a photo of my Chicken Ranch Club. That has no chicken. This is ridiculous. I am done going to this Mcd's.",
          "By far the absolute worst Mcdonalds in the\\nWorld. You can pretty much rest assured that, after your long wait in the drive thru, your order will most definitely be wrong.  Calls to the owner go ignored. Rice Enterprises own a majority of the McDonalds in the South Hills.  They have all gone down hill in quality, service and cleanliness.  The owner has to be the problem.",
          "By far the worst McDonald's in the world.  Employees are to busy playing grab ass behind the counter, to get your order correct.  Ninety percent of the time you receive the wrong order, after waiting what seems an eternity.  I've even enjoyed the experience of going through the drive thru, only to get home and find no beef patties on my Big Mac.  Save yourself the aggravation, and do not go here.",
          "Been yelled at by other customers (today for instance)...place is super ghetto...avoid at all cost. Today, left a full cart bacause a woman (with a baby in a stoller) shouted at me for \\\"cutting in line\\\". Will never go back. At night it is a nightmare.",

          "Got lunch from here today. \\n\\nWhat I sampled: \\nMaine Lobster Bisque (delicious and the whole reason for getting lunch from here)\\nCheeseburger (decent version I only ate about half, but I expect the other half won't last long)\\n\\nOverall I enjoy going here, though it is a bit overpriced, but sometimes I am just in the mood for that lobster bisque!",
          "The food here can actually be a little hit and miss, but I love the grilled cheese club with fries. I get it way too much. People make fun of me.\\n\\nThey have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards, fyi.",
          "Great service, friendly staff, great food, great prices. What more can you ask for in a small town breakfast place? Will definitely be back",
          "Great breakfast, good price. You might have to stand outside in line though, so I don't really recommend winter time to go. lol. Very friendly service, interesting coffee mugs. They have great deserts and such also. Bring your cash though as they dont' take cards.",
          "Have been here two times after stopping at Mancini's Bakery. Have only had the Hamburger/Cheese/Bacon w/ fries but huge portions and great price. Great Quality also. Server is really nice also. Will be eating here again. Heard the Breakfast items are also great. Saw the waffles and pancakes....were huge!",
          "BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.\\n\\nIt's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.",
          "Love this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line.",

          "Came here from PGH for the first time.  This bakery is legit.  I bought some Rye bread and Italian 5 grain.  Delicious.  A strange snickerdoodle thing with pink frosting.  Delicious. Chocolate chip cookie dipped in chocolate, extra chewy and humongous.  Delicious.\\n\\nAnd a sweet old lady serving em up.\\n\\nThe best.\\n\\nDelicious.",
          "Came across this place after checking out a Thai restaurant across the street. The name intrigued my family and I, and it looked like adorable from the outside. \\n\\nI fell in love instantly. And came back several times after first discovering this hidden gem. You walk in and the wonderful smells just overwhelm you in just an amazing way. The ambiance is that of an old style kitchen- personally, it reminds me of one of my aunts kitchens, which gives it that homey feel that is so comforting. They have seating- which I never saw in any bakeries prior to this one. They also serve coffee and encourage you to take a seat and enjoy your sweet treat. \\n\\nThey offer such a unique array of sweets. Definitely not your typical bakery. Pies, tortes, mooses and cookies.. And when they do have cinnamon rolls, grab them! They are a hot commodity! My personal favorite is their key lime pie. Oh my goodness. It's amazing. They have had it every time that I came, thank goodness. Their key lime cake is phenomenal as well. Their fruit tarts are incredible, the chocolate moose is amazing- they have a lot of items with fresh fruit which I love! \\n\\nMy only critiques- the hours: they are closed on Mondays and Sundays :/, not ideal for someone whose only day off is typically Sunday. And also, they write all the items thy have in the case on a small chalkboard posted on the wall to the right of the case. Every time I go, I find myself asking the employees what everything is, which I find to be a little annoying. Regardless- it's worth it. It's such a hidden gem and going there and experiencing their sweets is a real treat.",
          "Lincoln Bakery is yet another local bakery I've been meaning to try.  When a Google Offer came up, I took it so I would have no excuse to keep avoiding it.  The place has a nice neighborhood bakery feel; as I took in the many selections it seemed that everyone who came in was a regular.  There weren't many people when I was there (it was still relatively early) but I got the impression that at times there can be a line to the door.  \\nOne thing that I didn't like was although they had many pastries to choose from, nothing was labeled.  So I had to keep asking what things were.  The cinnamon roll was okay, nothing spectacular.  But the pastries I got were very good.  I'd recommend checking it out.  I know if I'm ever in the neighborhood I will stop in for a treat myself.",
          "This place has probably some of the best pastries I've ever encountered.  The treats are consistently great to amazing to even mouth watering.  The bakery is this quaint little place that is really cute with nice baking decorations and everything.  The staff is really friendly and always helpful with making the hard selection.  The cupcakes are these cream-stuffed pieces of heaven, and their signature sandwiches are out of this world.  Everything else leaves nothing to be desired, and keeps me coming back as frequently as I can find someone to accompany me.",
          "Cookies aren't bad.  Haven't had a reason to buy cakes or other pastries.  Staff is friendly and it smells like heaven.",
          "I arrived on a Thursday afternoon at 5pm when there was absolutely no other soul in the bakery (except for the staff). My pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright. I also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake. The key lime cake was definitely the best of the three.\\n\\nWhile I've been to better bakeries, I will definitely be back. I have heard stories of wonder and delight from other friends.\\n\\nThere is a small seating area with tables and a water dispenser for diners.",
          "Got a key lime pie from this place. It was horrid. Icing was stale cake thick, crust was not even crunchy or had taste, and the key lime was weak. Pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or 2.",
          "Quite possibly the best bakery in Pittsburgh.  It's got everything from the low-end (cookies, cupcakes, donuts) to the high (wedding cakes, tortes, tarts).  Make any special or large orders weeks in advance.  The tastiest wedding cake I ever sampled was from here: smooth buttercream icing with alternating raspberry and lemon filling in white batter.",
          "My sister, husband, and I went in after early dinner. It was completely unplanned but we were attracted to the quaint storefront. We purchased a crispy elephant ear-like dessert sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. It was glorious. I bought a piece of apple-walnut-cinnamon sugar cake with cream cheese frosting. It was delicious an moist. We also purchased freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. They were absolutely rich and scrumptious. The woman who was there an greeted us seemed like she might be the owner. She was sweet and very helpful. Great disposition. This is probably my favorite small bakery in Pittsburgh. Delightful.",
          "Lincoln Bakery makes very delicious donuts, pastries, and desserts. Their bread selection, however, was very limited and upon making our choice the quality of the bread was mediocre. We were also disappointed that many of the things in the shop are not labeled and when the store is busy it can be difficult to find staff to explain what different options are. Still, this should be a go to for a local bakery if you are looking for something sweet.",

And believe me, that's about all it has going for it!  You would think that this means you can find what you want, and generally you can, but it also means enormous crowds, no matter when you shop here.\\\\n\\\\nYou know that a trip to a large, \\\\\\\"one size fits all\\\\\\\" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at Macy's or Boscov's.  You know that it's pretty hard to give a place like this five stars.  Its purpose is purely utilitarian.  But good gravy, you'd think that a place like this could handle large crowds.  It shouldn't take you a half-hour just to get one item.  \\\\n\\\\nThat's what happened to me yesterday.  I would have been better off going to Cogo's or 7-11.  I might have paid a bit more, but I would have been in-and-out in under five minutes.  I prefer the Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill.\",\"Tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency.  fail.\",\"Fairly mediocre, even by the relatively modest standards of Home Depot. Unfortunately, this is probably the best you're going to do for hardware in most of Pittsburgh.\",\"I like Panera bread but this one is a so so. I always get my fuji chicken salad in every Panera bread I go. All of the other use spring mix to make their fuji chicken salad except this one.. They just use regular salad and salad doesn't taste or look very fresh either. I was kind of excited to find there is a panera bread around us but I am disappointed after trying it. Don't know if we will be back again.\",\"Best pierogies in tahn!  \\\\n\\\\nI usually just go with the standard potato and cheese but I've also tried a few of the other pierogies and some of the plus.  These pierogies can't be beat.  Made by hand with love in the traditional old world style, I have yet to find better.\\\\n\\\\nIt's amazing to get there at 10:55am, 5 minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies.  By 11am, the line is already out the door.  Always a good sign.  They serve their pierogies hot, cold or frozen.  I always go with the hot because nothing beats pierogies bathing in butter and onions.  And here at Pierogies Plus, they are definitely worth the wait.\",\"BEST COFFEE IN PITTSBURGH!\\\\n\\\\nYou might think there is better coffee elsewhere.  You're wrong!\\\\n\\\\nI love this coffee shop, and there is a second location the Gates Building at CMU that I like to go to--their panini are to die for.\\\\n\\\\nI love this place, and you will too!\",\"They have inaccurate hours posted. I tried to order at 11:30 pm when yelp says they close at 2am and they were already closed. When I told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said \\\\\\\"oh that's ok....\\\\\\\" And hung up on me. I will never be ordering from them again, which is a shame since they are so close to me. I immediately called Pizza Parma which gladly delivered to me. I recommend ordering from Pizza Parma since they have similar menu items, they post accurate hours, and they don't hang up on you! Seriously? Why answer the phone?\",\"I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.\\\\n\\\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good.\",\"Just finished a dinner of pierogies that our Pgh family brought to WV - always look forward to Pierogies Plus - try the apricot for a sweet treet!\",\"I will start by saying this review is for the hot bar and I must of gone at an off hour for the hot bar and by that I mean during the dinner rush before they replenished it. I would say everything I got from the salad bar to the hot bar was good apart from they had run out of soup/special of the day and the chicken was beyond dry, the time I spent in the dessert was a wet oasis compared to the chicken. I just feel that for the price I paid it was not worth it. I have been to a smaller whole foods with a better hot bar and to the one in New York City and remember it being great. I only give this one 3 stars because the Mac n cheese and vegan tofu loaf was rather good. But I must repeat myself about the price. For what I got it's way to much. It's hard to justify paying that much when I could make it for 1/5th the price at home. Now I know I don't have to cook or clean and that's the point of eating out but I could also go to trader joes get a few frozen meals and eat for over a day for the price of one hot bar meal from whole foods.\",\"So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\\\\n\\\\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\\\\n\\\\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \\\\n\\\\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\\\\n\\\\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. \\\\n\\\\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)\",\"Little slow on the service and didn't have the beer I wanted on the menu. But you get those things when they brew their own beers on-site.   But the stadium pretzels are good.  The cream stout is tasty.\\\\n\\\\nThe burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries.  I'm not a fan of the skinny fry, but hey the burgers would choke a horse - and almost did.  :o)\",\"Meh. I've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!\\\\n\\\\nTheir steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.\\\\n\\\\nThe seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain \\\\\\\"I taste like iodine\\\\\\\" flavor.\\\\n\\\\nThe advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive).\",\"Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.\",\"A delicious menu with a twist. Unique wine list too!\",\"$9.75 for a red bull and vodka? I'm sorry, I thought I was in Pittsburgh, not New York City. Sing Sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if I could have more than one watered down drink before I warbled my way through \\\\\\\"Paradise City\\\\\\\" with the rest of the crowd.\",\"Best Cafe in Pittsburgh - like a hidden gem. The sandwiches are delicious, you must try the chocolate chip brownie, and the coffee is great and made exactly the way you like it.\",\"Went with a group after work for dinner and a brew.  We ordered a few appetizers first.  The wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun.  Had a burger, you can create your own from veggie, turkey, or fresh ground beef. Had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun.\\\\n\\\\nThe brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasn't busier.\",\"On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  \\\\n\\\\nInside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \\\\n\\\\nOne random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \\\\n\\\\nNot only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.\",\"I have been looking for 3 years for good crab rangoon - I finally found it!!!  We had boneless ribs that were absolutely wonderful.  Definitely going back!!!\",\"The Frick Car and Carriage Museum is interesting and fun. They play very informative short films in a screening room and the docents there are very friendly, helpful people. The Car and Carriage Museum is very well worth going to. And the amazing part is that is free. \\\\n\\\\nThe Frick Art Museum is not really that interesting or great. There is hardly anything of note. As far as I can see, Helen Frick had way more money than taste and money can't buy you taste. When J.P. Morgan died, he donated his entire art collection to the Met in New York. However the Met did not want everything. Helen Frick bought many pieces that the Met had already passed on, with good reason. Of course not all of the Frick Art collection consists of the Met's castoffs. There many portraits of insignificant nobility done by French court painters who had little talent. Just bec. art is old or expensive, doesn't mean it's really any good. It's a good thing this museum is free.\",\"This place was recommended by an employee at Evolve spa across the street and I was very happy with the restaurant. The Salmon appetizer was delicious as was the gnocchi meal. I will definitely go back to this restaurant when I visit the area.\",\"The food was okay. The noise level--with 10 people in a huge room--deafening. Awful acoustics!\",\"Ahh, the only place near the train station that is open past 9 PM, isn't overpriced and/or full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour. I got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. The pizza was decent. There was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. I felt sick before I got halfway through it. That reminds me - the slices are HUGE, and are $2. The onion rings were extremely basic - I gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.\\\\nOne irritating thing I overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like \\\\\\\"we don't have those anymore\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"no, we can't cook wings dry.\\\\\\\" Sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated.\",\"Well, I think Heidi S. pretty much covered all of the bases here. The lemon-ginger tea that I ordered was weak, perhaps not steeped hot enough? The hummus, wow, definitely the worst; tasted like paste. Yuck with a capital whY. I considered giving two stars because the service and atmosphere were pleasant, but since I do not plan to return, I guess methinks not.\",\"The people who work here are very rude. I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person, but no it happen every time. I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. It is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them. The people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation. Plus it is very dirty. Perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other. I will not go back again.\",\"living alone I love the 5 for $20 deals they have on meat. I also love Faygo products when I have a party or bbq so their sales are always right on time. They don't have as many stores in the area but they are worth checking out. The lines are a lot shorter and the staff is a lot friendlier.\",\"This is my go-to place for curing a hangover. I don't know what it is about Chinese buffets the day after a long night of round after round, but it does the trick. I also like to come here before I go grocery shopping at the nearby Trader Joe's because everybody knows it's a bad idea to go shopping for food stuff on an empty stomach.\\\\n\\\\nAll of my favorites are here, veggie lo mien, string beans, mac 'n cheese, crab rangoon, hot & sour soup, I haven't seen dan bing (egg pancakes) in awhile but when they have them, they are out of this world with some peanut sauce. Another thing I miss is creamed spinach... I have yet to see this dish on a Pittsburgh buffet but if you go outside of the city it is a staple among Chines buffets.\\\\n\\\\nAnother star got knocked off for the lack of fresh fruit on the dessert table. Canned pineapple and mandarin oranges will always carry that metallic taste to them that is just no comparison to having the real thing.\",\"I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail.  I love little local restaurants like this.  But it really is a very tight squeeze, to begin with.  They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.  For dinner though, unless you like super-bland food, I probably wouldn't return for seconds.\",\"Your typical area big box hardware store.  It's convenient to go to because of the proximity to other stores and how close it is to so many communities.\\\\n\\\\nCan't really say much else about this place other than with the self checkout lanes it's a breeze to run in and then out without having to deal with a single associate.\",\"SUMMARY:\\\\nIf I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.\\\\n\\\\nGOOD:\\\\n- Decent beer...\\\\n- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.\\\\n- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.\\\\n- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.\\\\n- Amusing name.\\\\n\\\\nBAD:\\\\n- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\\\\n- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.\\\\n- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.\\\\n\\\\nCome if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low.\",\"I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \\\\n\\\\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\\\\n\\\\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\\\\n\\\\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \\\\n\\\\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \\\\\\\"mistake\\\\\\\" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\\\\n\\\\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.\",\"Great little gem! The food was fantastic was very food and just the right price. The Italian food was amazing, but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving. I had the carrot cake yummy!! Def a place everyone should try.\",\"Pretty good bar food.  It's conveniently located and a fun atmosphere.\",\"The service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. I had a bus to catch so I couldn't wait around waiting for the check so I went to the counter to pay. She never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors. \\\\n\\\\nThe burger was really greasy, the fries were Luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed.\",\"I'm not much of a beer drinker, but my fiancee is a major enthusiast, so I agreed to tag along.  I'm glad I did!  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.  My only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy, and I spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  Not sure I would make the hour+ trip to Pittsburgh again, but if I found myself in the city, I may just stop by.\",\"Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. The server was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Maybe they were short handed.  The food was to me not even average. I ordered a burger, which very overdone and dry. Had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalape\\\\u00f1o slice on each piece. Imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  Not like any nachos I've ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them.\",\"Stars are for the food only.    2.5 rating\\\\n\\\\nGot there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. \\\\n\\\\nThe service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.  \\\\n\\\\nI think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation.\",\"I go to Rock Bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer, so I was really really excited to have my bridal shower there.  My maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  My MOH and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!\\\\n\\\\nAlso, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun!\",\"My husbands first time.  Nice to be able to pick your fish and style of cooking.  I had a trio of Jamaican jerk tilapia,  salmon,  and scallops.  All good but too much sauce on scallops.  Husband had surf n turf special. Snow crab legs tasty but smaller portion than I expected. Glad they had raw oysters,  but no idea where they were from.  For $2.50 each you'd think they'd say.  Waitstaff friendly but inexperienced when it came to wine.  We taught two of them how to open a champagne bottle.  Nice time out,  but two gripes... #1 Used my phones flashlight to see if there was an outlet on the floor.  Felt like an archaeologist finding old remains of dinners gone by.  Crumbs,  napkins wedged between booth and wall,  gum,  dirt.  For the price I would expect a cleaner place. #2 our waiter kept saying Thank you. After every single sentence,  even when it wasn't appropriate.  Silly gripe,  right?  But it was way over the top and felt more like,  Can I have a tip?  Can I have a tip?\",\"There was absolutely nothing not to like.  Reasonably priced wines, home style Italian cooking. Great upbeat ambience.\",\"So...we got here and seated by 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now it is 752pm. One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. I had\\\\nMy shrimp diablo. It was as described. Spicy and good!!! But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. We also sent an order of chicken fingers back...dryer than sand. And my fianc\\\\u00e9s chicken Caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers. Barely edible, in fact, she didn't eat more than 3 pieces of it. Upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better.\",\"Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. \\\\n\\\\nTo recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?\\\\n\\\\nIt's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. \\\\n\\\\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \\\\n\\\\nI really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. \\\\n\\\\nGet it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ;  ).  Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music.  And fun patrons.\",\"Given that the Rusty Nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources, I'm sad to say I was sorely disappointed. \\\\n\\\\nThey have a wide selection of breakfast options.  However, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes AND toast.  Yes, that's right.  I had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  When my food was served, the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  I did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which I ordered deep fried.  My dining companion ordered the French toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.  \\\\n\\\\nWe were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded.  The service was good.  And it's not that I thought anything was bad, it's just that, as the two star rating says, \\\\\\\"Meh, I've experienced better.\\\\\\\"  Given the plethora of choices in Bellevue, this will not be my first stop should I find myself on Lincoln Avenue for breakfast again.\",\"Came here to see Charlie Murphy. \\\\nParking was nightmare. I would expect nothing less on a Saturday night.\\\\nThe 15 minute wait to get inside was torture. They need to implement a system where if you purchased tickets in advance you don't have to wait outside. Once inside you we were seated pretty quickly.\\\\nSeating is first come first serve.\\\\n\\\\nThe Server was pretty quick to take our orders. I misread the menu description and didn't realize my BBQ sandwich came \\\\nwith cheese.  I don't eat cheese, and had send my order back. The waiter was gracious and returned with my modified order in about 15 minutes. I've never heard of throwing cheese pulled pork sandwich, maybe it's a northern thing. \\\\nWe got our checks quickly, and without issue.\",\"Beer selection was good, but they were out of the ones we wanted. 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction. The bourbanzola was a good addition. Defiantly a place I would go again. Joe, our server, was awesome and super friendly.\",\"Even when we didn't have a car Filene's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \\\\n\\\\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.\\\\n\\\\nI like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town.\",\"God i hate eat n park. Only reason i have gone is for the salad bar because u cant find a decent salad bar in this city. Just about every entree iv had here is nothing more than rubbish, except maybe the cheesteak. Only go if u have little kids\",\"Coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  The tables, the decorations, the menu.  All the same.  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes.\\\\n\\\\nI ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  Very very oily.  The actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  Did I mention that?  \\\\n\\\\nAmbiance, like I said, left much to be desired.  I don't think I'd have this place on my list of \\\\\\\"musts\\\\\\\" for downtown.  Much better restaurants to visit!\",\"Great cafe for brunch and coffee. Lots of vegetarian options and nice atmosphere. Come check out the place if you're in the area and would like to try some healthy foods. Was here for some brunch with friends and our food did take a while to make it to the table but everyone enjoyed their meal. If you come too late during the evenings for dinner the food options are less then what's on the menu.\",\"I've been here twice now, and like the others you really only come to Improve Comedy Club for the show. Very reasonably priced for shows  though they have the two item minimum so would suggest they all be drinks.\\\\n\\\\nThe food leaves little to be desired. We decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at 7. Having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken. Spinach and artichoke dip was good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chips. Sauteed grilled chicken - hmmm.... I think the chicken was frozen - definitely not fresh - and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese. It looked like a mess with big ole pile of fries. A lot of food for $10. Service has always been pleasant though they do automatically tack on the tip for you at 18%.\",\"Sadly I've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \\\\\\\"alright\\\\\\\" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\\\\n\\\\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\\\\n\\\\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\\\\n\\\\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.\",\"Rather typical SnS.  Had a good lunch crowd.  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street.  It took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS.  Ordered the Guacamole Steakburger and it only had a small portion of Gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.  Definitely did not look like the picture on the website.  Oh well!\",\"My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic, nice decor. I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place.\",\"ok so i've eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it. now, i'll be honest this is the only one i've ever been to, so i don't know if they're all the same but every time i'm underwhelmed. i get there, look at their giant selection and get excited. then i get my meal and remember that i've never had anything too great. don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but for how much they charge, they really need to step it up or at least give me a huge portion. just saying...\",\"We stopped by Quiet Storm for a late lunch while on vacation in Pittsburgh.  The food was excellent.  I had the cheese steak and my husband had a peanut tofu wrap, both were served with chips.  Everything was great.  If I had any complaint it would be that I didn't see on the menu that my cheese steak had mayo on it.  I'm not a big fan of it, so had I see that I would have asked for it without.  Other then that great place!\",\"There's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  Our orders were somewhat mixed up.  The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  The crust was delicious and homemade.  If you are going to order something, I would go with the pizza.  We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  If you are looking for good food, Homestead better choices at Blue Dust or Tin Front.\",\"OMG good pierogis in a classic blue collar 'hood. At first glance, it looks like a place to get a flat fixed on your tire. Instead, I re-learn why I always avoid the corporate food franchises and seek places like this out. Just go there and eat whatever the nice woman behind the counter tells you to! It's well worth the mapquest ...\",\"They do great quality work. The only reason I did not give them five stars is for their lack of customer courtesy not once but twice. I am a very patient and understanding person, but being rude twice means you dont want my business and I tipped 20%.\",\"I heart King's. I've always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in Monaca.\",\"I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. \\\\n\\\\nBaked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. \\\\nLazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. \\\\nPanna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? \\\\nWe tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.\\\\n\\\\nI don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there.\",\"Sub-par setting quality, infrequent wall resetting, inconsistent grading, poor climate control, poor air quality (no chalk filter), silly rule where they make everyone wear paper wristbands before entry. + 1 star because they are finally installing air conditioning.\",\"Best coffee it Pittsburgh? Maybe, but this place is certainly competitive. French Press, Drip, espresso, or pour over? You name it they've got it. Only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. If it is just coffee you want you this is the place. It is it a bit snobbish sure, but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in Pittsburgh.\",\"I'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this TGI Fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the \\\\\\\"chain\\\\\\\" expectation. \\\\n\\\\nI order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird.\\\\n\\\\nFortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly. \\\\n\\\\nI'd recommend the TGI Fridays out in South Hills Village over this one any day.\",\"Although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! Outrageous !\\\\nThere is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. I will most likely not return. Very overpriced for the quality and service.\",\"I made it back here about two weeks ago.  I must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of July.  Whether or not it was an off night I do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best.  I should have just waited it out at Point Brugge.  I won't becoming back anytime soon.\",\"Overall a good experience. Food was mostly very good. My sweet pea risotto was just OK. My wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. Neither of us are big eaters, but noted how small the portions were, especially compared to the price. One cup of risotto for $20+? Four ravioli for the same?\\\\n\\\\nThey altered the desert recipe on request, which for sure was over and above the call.\\\\n\\\\nService was attentive and the setting nice.\",\"Great environment at night! Songs going on very lively!! The food of my friends who ordered burger and fried shrimps was not that great. But I ordered chicken flatbread which was really delicious! Absolutely loved it  will definitely go here again just for the flatbreads\",\"I had always meant to visit Enrico's, and since my friend recently moved to the neighborhood, it was a perfect opportunity to cross it off my list.\\\\n\\\\nSo here's what I liked: the cappuccino was perfect. It's an awesome cappuccino, topped with a cute foam art leaf.\\\\n\\\\nHere's what I didn't like: Sometimes I take my cappuccino plain, sometimes I take it with a shot of syrup. On this occassion I asked if I could get amaretto syrup, which they had. But the barista responded: \\\\\\\"No, you can't.\\\\\\\" He said they only make their cappuccino plain, and if I liked sweet, he could make me something special, but I would have to trust his taste. Here's the thing...I don't like sweet! I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. I just got it plain.\\\\n\\\\nI'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a Starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a \\\\\\\"REAL\\\\\\\" cappuccino tasted like. Please, I lived in Italy, I've had a \\\\\\\"REAL\\\\\\\" cappuccino...but right now, I want a flavor shot in it. I still tipped because I wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place, and he did offer to make me something different. I just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not \\\\\\\"allowed\\\\\\\" to add them to your drink? \\\\n\\\\nIt's a 5-star cappuccino for sure, but I had to subtract a star for the attitude.\",\"I've eaten just once, mostly I go for drinks. Nice, lively place, nice outdoor seating for the summer and fall.\\\\nDrinks are good, service is good.\\\\nLocation is great as well, right across the movie theater.\",\"My husband and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town, we made reservations here because word on the street was that it was good. Verdict? It was so-so. We had reservations at 7:15 and were seated promptly, which was fine, except we were seated OUTSIDE! Listen folks, it's COLD when the sun goes down. They have three tables set outside, I guess trying to squeeze out some more business. Our server was nice, but not attentive at all.  We were left waiting for things for 10-20 minutes at a time. Also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. It took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. Wine was good. Food was ehhhhhh. We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all.  The best part of the night? Leaving. The worst part of the night? Associating this place with my anniversary.\",\"This thrift store is one of the best in Pittsburgh; it's huge and has a great selection of books, clothes and housewares.\\\\n\\\\nWith that being said, there are a number of drawbacks to shopping here because of its popularity. It starts with the parking. There are a few spots in front of the store, with two \\\\\\\"overflow\\\\\\\" lots that quickly fill up. Getting out is a bear if you're heading back towards the city, like I usually am, because to pull up to the traffic light you have to go the wrong way through the very narrow parking area in front of the store. Crossing three lanes on 51 without the help of a traffic light just seems like a bad plan.\\\\n\\\\nOnce inside the store, beware of other customers on the weekends. I've encountered aggressive shoppers on multiple occasions who are usually welding carts as weapons. Let's just say some shoppers think it's OK to block off entire aisles so they can peruse a section.\\\\n\\\\nOther notes: There are no fitting rooms. I sometimes try on clothes over the ones I'm wearing in front of a mirror, because hey, it's a thrift store.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, they're cash only.\\\\n\\\\nDespite these setbacks, I find myself coming back every few months because I've found some really awesome things here, from dresses to plates. Just think of the trip as a little adventure.\",\"MEAN CUSTOMERS -ALOOF WORKERS+GOOD FOOD = CRAZY!\\\\n\\\\nOfficial Rant of an Angry Woman:\\\\n\\\\nFirst off - I shop at \\\\\\\"Whole Paycheck\\\\\\\" cause my household eats organic and whether I like it or not WF has the best organic food prices in my neck of the woods.

Dick's seems to be the big chain for sporting paraphernalia in this neck of the woods. Their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section. Maybe it's good for small children who want their first snowboard? It is a very average store with average products. I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. I am not into fishing or hunting live prey so I am not sure about these departments? I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products.\",\"Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.\\\\n\\\\nRemember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie\\\\n\\\\nI can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.\\\\n\\\\nNow here comes the bad:\\\\n\\\\n1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.\\\\n\\\\n2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.\\\\n\\\\n3.

That's an unpleasant prospect to face down after a hard night of drinking, which is the only time the idea of brunch ever occurs to me.  But then, the grim Spectre of Laziness appeared to me and asked, \\\\\\\"Do you really want to drive to another place?  Just look at you. Your wearing the same shirt that you wore yesterday dude.\\\\\\\"  \\\\n\\\\nThe Spectre of Laziness is a dick, but he was also right.  And to my surprise, nothing I had was bad at all.  For brunch options, meat eaters will find that potatoes and eggs are the cornerstone of any breakfast, and seitan substitutions are not as bad as say, having the grim Spectre of Laziness point out your slovenly appearance.  \\\\n\\\\nI think the biggest surprise in this place is that, though nothing is particularly jarring to the palate, there is nothing that really stands out as being amazing.  In Yelp terms: it's kind of a 3.  For hard core vegetarians having a night, er, mid-afternoon on the town, it's probably a blessed change from the meat based culture that Pittsburgh is pretty famous for.  But I'm willing to wager that very meat eaters will become converted to vegetarians after this.  Maybe they did TOO good of a job substituting meat items.  That being said, we did make it back another time for lunch where I had a vegetarian gyro.  My friend said it best: \\\\\\\"What's the fucking point?\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe service is always very sweet, but both times the waiters have been curiously, nay ominously spacey.  Even when it wasn't crowded there had to be some substantial flag downs and polite and doleful eye contact before they would do what you needed.  If you're in the area and looking for...this type of thing, you really don't have too many other options so just eat it.\",\"Minutello's is going out of business.

However, this particular one is currently being remodeled. Children's clothing, toys, electronics and health & beauty items have been moved to other parts of the store. There is a new Starbucks that is now open. The cafe that is there has been remodeled and will serve Pizza Hut pizza and other new menu items. The area where the electronics used to be it is now going to have a small grocery section. Basically, this Target in Homestead will eventually look like the one in East Liberty. I like this Target, so I am pleased with the new changes (especially Starbucks)!\",\"This is a cozy little place. I made last minute reservations for a Saturday evening because the restaurant we were supposed to go to  closed due to an emergency. Major bummer for us, but life goes on and luckily we were able to get a table at this place. At first we were seated by the register area and that was a little awkward because it felt like the hostess and waitresses were right at the table with us. I wasn't in the mood for a large group dinner so we asked to be moved, a request they graciously accomodated. Unfortunately, we were then seated pretty close to the door and it was a cold February evening so that was a little rough. Fortunately, we had a whole bottle of wine to warm us up.\\\\n\\\\nOK, so now let's talk about the wine thing: \\\\nthis is the first BYOB place I've ever eaten at and I loved it! It's pretty great to share a bottle of wine that you can pick out yourself, rather than spend a fortune on some ordinary bottle offered by the restaurant. I didn't know if we had to open the bottle ourselves and brought a cork screw just in case, but turns out they open it for you; I can't remember if there was a corkage fee, but it they do it's a small fee.\\\\n\\\\nNow, for the food: we shared a sardine appetizer and it was quite good. The bread was also really delicious, very fresh and soft. For my entree I ordered the lobster tail and that was very tasty! The veggies served alongside were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light and flavorful. We ended the meal with a chocolate mousse, which my partner didn't love, but I thought it was pretty good, definitely not the best I've had, but good!\\\\n\\\\nTo sum it all up: good food, cozy place, and friendly staff!\",\"Went to this place on a Groupon and fell in love. It reminds me of the days when I lived in Denver. I miss it! The routes are decently hard and allow me to push myself to get better. Staff has always been awesome. People there help give pointers.

I'll be seeing you a lot for the next year :)\",\"I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.\\\\n\\\\nMy pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.\\\\n\\\\nWell, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. \\\\n\\\\nThe first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. \\\\n\\\\nCan I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.\\\\n\\\\nI know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)\",\"After three trips to Quiet Storm I am hooked.

From the bad service, to the diluted soup, to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad, to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!\",\"I have to say that I have had quick and efficient stops in here for all of my car needs. Firstly, walking into this building is quite a spectacle, from the beautiful exterior and interior. I have to be honest, my first trip in here I felt like taking my escalator down into the pit that is AAA was equivalent to taking a trip into the fifth ring of hell. I hate anything dealing with the DMV, registration, license, tags, blah blah blah. However, both of the times I stopped in here it was not crowded at all, and the women that helped me were very nice and thoughtful. The stations you must go through are quick and effective. Both times I had business here, I was in and out in less than a half hour- which was far better than the marathon nightmare I was expecting.\",\"Hoofah.\",\"In general I do like Shake N' Steak, but this location is a hit or miss location!  You never know what kind of quality or service you're going to find here.  A friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there EVER!  You can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part. However, while she can't be accountable for the slooooow service, she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.  The burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best...\\\\n\\\\nBy far my worst visit to Steak n' Shake!\",\"I was determined to let this one pass (experience was not worth commentary) until I made a disturbing discovery...\\\\n\\\\nI made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, \\\\\\\"the host is supposed to do that but I will...\\\\\\\" Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. \\\\n\\\\nI was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. \\\\n\\\\nCasbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.\\\\n\\\\n**Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!\",\"I love hardware stores.  LOVE.  But this Home Depot has disappointed me.  The location is great, but the floor staff is unhelpful.\\\\n\\\\nTonight was a great example of I don't like the floor staff.  My vacuum stopped picking up anything but the largest pieces of dust.  After opening her up, I quickly realized I needed a new belt.  It was pouring down rain, but I put on my rainboots, grabbed an umbrella, and hoofed it over to ye ole Home Depot.  I had to stand over the shoulders of five--yep, I counted five--employees in appliances for a full minute before one of them would help me.\\\\n\\\\nAfter someone directed me to the vacuum parts, I had two male employees stop by to see if I needed help as I searched for the correct belt.  I had the vacuum's name and number written down, as well as the belt style, and had the actual busted belt with me.  Yet, each of these men acted like I was some stupid girl.  \\\\\\\"Did you unplug the vacuum before you removed the old belt?\\\\\\\" one asked me.  Duh.  I'm not an idiot.  The other later asked, \\\\\\\"Do you always wear bright yellow rainboots when you're doing repairs?\\\\\\\" and snickered.  Look, all I said to both gentlemen was \\\\\\\"I'm just looking for the correct style number.  But thanks.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI received similar treatment I stopped by to buy a new set of bits for my drill.  \\\\\\\"You know drills come in more than one kind, right?\\\\\\\" I was asked.

It's situated on a nice residential block near a large liquor store (byob).  The ambiance is fantastic and the staff are warm, friendly and attentive. We were seated in the private back room because no other tables were available. A real VIP treatment.  \\\\nFor starters, the goat cheese pastry and smoked salmon appetizers were to die for. Many of the others sounded great too.  Our daughter, who is at college here, was missing some of the food options of NY. Not any more. She had the lamb burger with feta cheese. I had the seafood stew and my wife had Chilean sea bass.  All fantastic! Thankfully we had just enough room for tres leches dessert. If anyone knows of a Portuguese restaurant this good in NYC ... or even in Newark Ironbound I'd love to hear about it.  We will definitely be back!\",\"Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  But, that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again.\",\"The food was really good, but the prices were pretty high and the portions were on the small side. The desserts were the high point of the meal for me. I got the \\\\\\\"shark fin\\\\\\\" pie and it was really good. The waitress thought I wouldn't be able to finish it... but I showed her. Take that, waitress.\",\"The experience was not that great. The lady taking the orders was nice, but not helpful with what to order. The owner kept her back turn to us the entire time, based on the pictures and news articles I read about her I thought she would have been more social. To what really matters we got #2 sampler and order of jalape\\\\u00f1o pierogies and the Ruben pierogies a lot of food for two guys. Really had no idea what to expect. Haluski was good, the pierogies came Luke warm and soaked in oily butter. Like the cab driver said you can find better. I'd pass on this spot.\",\"Fast food in a resturant setting.  Considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go.  Must be a reason why this place is always packed.\",\"Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?).\",\"So I went on a marathon 2 hour bike ride right before heading to Enrico's for the first time and on my last mile all I could think was \\\\\\\"iced caffe mocha, iced caffe mocha\\\\\\\" over and over again.  Did I mention that I forgot my water bottle on my ride too?  I was a desperate woman at the end of that one.\\\\n\\\\nSo I got home aired myself out and drove myself to Enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there.  There was easy street parking right out front and I really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street.  Tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.\\\\n\\\\nSo why the 3 stars?  Well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar.  The syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery.  Could have been a better mix.  Would I give this another try?  Sure but I definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swig.\\\\n\\\\nThe coffee place at the Walnut Mall in Shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award.  Try the iced OR blended ghiradelli mocha when you are shopping Shady-style - AWESOME!\",\"This place.. Is ok if ur grabn something quick .. But they do have a great happy hour tho\",\"Lately, the Rock Bottom is hit or miss. The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I've ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food. I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom.\",\"A few hours before the event, we happened across the ad in the City Paper and decided to give it a shot.  We were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery.  Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple.  Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something.  In the end, we chose not to spend the extra $15 to make another garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen our 'instructor' met with us, he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear.  He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds.  Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything!  From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I would've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue.  Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn.\\\\n\\\\nWe then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats.  The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm.\\\\n\\\\nThe gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch.\\\\n\\\\nIn the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!).  It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals).  We would have liked to have a small 'info talk' about the steps that will take place, why they are that way, the tools used, maybe some quick science behind it, then get to work on the item.\",\"Wasn't terrible,\\\\nBut certainly wasn't great.\\\\nSave your hard-earned cash.\",\"You're getting an extra star for two solid reasons.  \\\\n\\\\nOne is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again (and a bit fancier).  Two, and thee most important part, this iggle has the best quality and well made sushi out of any Iggle's out there!  Believe me, I've eaten many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the Burgh and nothing has compared.  Dare I say, it's as close as you get to going to a good sushi restaurant.  Bold statement, right? \\\\n\\\\nI  just love me some sushi and want it often, quick and convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality.  Need a quick sushi fix?  This place is it!\",\"When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\\\\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place.\",\"This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \\\\n\\\\nI only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr\\\\u00e9es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price.\",\"Ooooppss...update time.   Got the regular (steamed spinach and lasagna) from the hot bar on my way to work.   So, I'm on my dinner break sitting, chatting it up with a co worker while eating.  I see something white in the spinach just before putting it in my mouth.  WTF is that!  OMG, it looks like one of those fat ass worms we'd  pluck from the greens in my grandma's garden.  I threw the fork down and my co worker says...\\\\\\\" you're seeing stuff.\\\\\\\"  Um NOT!  I sat there digging through the spinach determined to find that damn worm.  Thirty minutes later  SHAZAM...found it. Ugh, my coworker spread open the spinach leaf.  EEEkkkk, it was bigger and fatter with black spikes poking out.  FUCK!  Call the manager at Co-op and he says...\\\\\\\"Bring it in for a refund, thanks for being so nice about it...We usually just see worms in the fruits.\\\\\\\"  Geez, thanks for that lil tidbit.    This happened last week around the Sept 14, 2010.  Guess that means it's really organic, huh?\",\"Dirty slick holds. Hate the fact I can't move mats. Some problems were fun, some were awful. The staff is very unfriendly. Unless you're part if the clique no one will talk to you.\",\"We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\\\\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \\\\n\\\\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \\\\\\\"event\\\\\\\". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\\\\n\\\\nMy car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.\\\\n\\\\nThe Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv. I'd give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.\",\"I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole, hipster employees and presumptuous, anti-bourgeois customers that will literally push you aside a turn their noses up at you a million times. The rumors were true!!! \\\\n\\\\nEven though I was only there one time, first impressions are a bitch! The selection is great! I can't afford any of it, but it's great! I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...\\\\n\\\\nThe food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+\\\\n\\\\nThe employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen \\\\\\\"workers\\\\\\\" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating \\\\\\\"We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask\\\\\\\" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!\\\\n\\\\nThe other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!\\\\n\\\\nSo unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?\\\\n\\\\nI'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk.\",\"Nope!\",\"Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad.\",\"Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.\\\\n\\\\nThe bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nI'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.\",\"pretty good veggie food.  I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here.  French toast, tofu scramble, museli, salads, sandwiches, lasagna.  They have a pretty decent variety.\",\"Pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  The food is tasty but not transcendent.  The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  The food is essentially slightly hipper Olive Garden fare at double the prices.\\\\n\\\\nFor dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).\\\\n\\\\nPino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.  My friend and I were the only males there.  If cougar hunting is your sport of choice, you'll feel right at home in Pino's jungle safari!\",\"NO WI-FI.  Just FYI.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen I lived in Cleveland and my first (truly terrible) apartment had no wi-fi Whole Foods was my second home...I would buy a little sampler of buffet foods and salads, a coffee, maybe a vegan cookie, and park myself at a booth for an hour (or more, let's be real).  After I taught a yoga class.  I know, I know, I'm such a white liberal yuppie, it's painful.\\\\n\\\\nAnyway, so when the internet went out at my Pittsburgh home I trotted off to Whole Foods, bought some food and a coffee...and asked about the wi-fi.  \\\\\\\"We have it,\\\\\\\" said Cashier #1.  \\\\\\\"It's probably just under \\\\\\\"Whole Foods.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We have it,\\\\\\\" said Cashier #2, \\\\\\\"but I don't know the password - ask customer service.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We don't have it,\\\\\\\" said Customer Service, \\\\\\\"go to Starbucks.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBelieve it or not, Starbucks is letting me drink my coffee & eat my vegan cookie and didn't make me buy anything.\\\\n\\\\nNO WI-FI.  Otherwise, this Whole Foods is pretty good.\",\"I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \\\\\\\"The Hangover\\\\\\\" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \\\\\\\"The Hangover\\\\\\\" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.\",\"Went several nights in a row: Thursday, Saturday & Sunday. I cannot say enough how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! Every night was different: African night, Latin Dance, Brass Band (that was amazing). The Ownership is way friendly & open to chatting which I love. The bartenders are open, friendly & genuine...anyone who remembers my name & my drink is a winner in my book!

To me this is excellent service. Makes you feel like coming back.\\\\nI would have to admit that I usually order the garlic fries which are really great. I do this if I am not going back to the office or out to meet a client.\\\\nNormally I would add a soup of the day which are always nice, and a sandwich of the day. \\\\nI have never been disappointed and certainly would continue to conduct business lunches here.

There was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. As I expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience.

They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well.

Much more upscale than I had thought it would be.  The service was terrific.  Lots of things to choose from on the menu.  A bit pricier than I had imagined.

The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back\",\"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  \\\\n\\\\nI was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.\\\\n\\\\nOrdered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back.\",\"When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\\\\n\\\\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \\\\n\\\\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\\\\n\\\\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\\\\n\\\\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\\\\n\\\\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\\\\n\\\\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!\",\"I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace.  Bad idea.  My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and \\\\\\\"Italian frites.\\\\\\\"  The latter, which the menu described as \\\\\\\"fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,\\\\\\\" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!\\\\n\\\\nAs a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a \\\\\\\"nice\\\\\\\" restaurant?  Classless.\\\\n\\\\nConclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's.\",\"Great friendly service and my order was done fast, which was amazing since I was a walk-in. Lots of toppings piled high but I wish there was more cheese. They did have small bottles of vanilla Coke, which is a rare find these days.\",\"I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  We literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering.\",\"I had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order. The food tasted frozen and microwaved. Nothing special just around average!\",\"I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).\",\"The grounds are very nice here, but I have to say the part I loved best was the collection of cars. I've never seen so many antique vehicles in one place. Definitely makes it worth checking out. However. The location is a bit wacky. It's right outside of Wilkinsburg, which isn't a place to visit at all. But still, it is nice enough to check out. Especially if you want to just go have a nice lunch at the cafe.\",\"We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server, was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.\\\\nBoth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink, I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back.\\\\nCan't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself.\",\"Horrifying.  This place should be ashamed of itself.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  Beyond dirty, just absolutely rank.\",\"I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people, I was totally disappointed with the service, food, and the place itself, I will not be headed back......ever\\\\nSave your money, or starve either would be a better option\",\"Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back.\",\"Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.\",\"Among the best of the 'burgh.  Great live acts on a regular basis.\",\"So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \\\\n\\\\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\\\\n\\\\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\\\\n\\\\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \\\\n\\\\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink...\",\"We ordered from here because Uncle Chen, our go-to takeout place down the road, was closed. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the General Tso tofu, a favorite dish of mine, and hubby ordered the beef Mei Fun noodles. We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.\\\\n\\\\nThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\\\\n\\\\nSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great. If you're looking for a quick fix to your Chinese food craving, this is a good place to order from, although I'll be going back to Uncle Chen before I try China Sea again.\",\"Good! I can't comment on the food or the bathrooms, but from what experienced it was great! The drinks were decent, and I  believe you must order two items at minimum. The staff is quick, but they should have more people working on a Saturday night. Before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchen.\\\\n\\\\nThe comics we saw were funny as well. Will definitely go back!\",\"We are fans of Pistella Beer Distributors simply because we needed beer one night while visiting some friends and family in Pittsburgh and they happened to be on the way to something we were doing.  It's a hole in the wall kind of facade but they do have a good selection.  I don't remember the price being that expensive but looking at the average review so far...it shows $$$$.  I'm sure they have some nice stuff, but we just got a case of beer (I think one of those Magic Hat variety packs) and it seemed similar to what we would pay in the other stores.  Anyway, we had a good experience with this place and don't really have anything bad to say about them.\",\"This place is cool!  But it is also 'cool'.  Service is so-so, but the staff doesn't have an attitude, they just aren't into serving.  And I'm not a vegan, but the food is so good that a carnivore like me doesn't even care. The menu is also huge.  \\\\n\\\\nFor those of you looking for an ATM- there's one a half block away if you just exit, go left and cross the street to the corer convenience store.\\\\n\\\\nI could always find a table and spread out with my books. Comfy, young, hip, worth it.  I wish they had alcohol.\\\\n\\\\nTry it!\",\"Really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour. No one wants to pay $8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality.\",\"Tonight's review: it started with a table for two stuffed between two other tables. Yes there were five other more comfortable two tops available. We asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request. Punishment was fast...we sipped our water, were provided a refill but no offer to acquire other beverages. With plenty of time to review the night's menu, we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had offended by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment. YES I will return and still recommend Casbah. Oh we did finally get to place a cocktail order.  \\\\nM\",\"Since both Marshalls and TJ Maxx are owned by the same company, I make sure to stop by both locations when shopping at the Waterfront. I generally find nothing or spend only $10 or so at Marshalls, while being enticed to spend at least $50-100 at TJ Maxx. The Waterfront TJ Maxx seems to have not only the same product as this Marshalls plus a whole lot more. All that to say, I consider shopping here a waste of time since I could just drive a block or so and be at a store owned by the same company that always has what I want and need. Sorry, Marshalls, but you're just OK to me.\",\"Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself.\",\"It was the first time that I went to this location.  We sat outside and it was a beautiful night.  I had the BBQ Burger with fries.  For the price of the burger I expected something much better.  It was a very thin burger when it came to the meat.  As a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it.  In addition, their drinks are expensive!  Just one cocktail could run between $10-$12 and they aren't very large.  Our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs.  There are enough restaurants at the Waterfront that I don't know that I will come back here.\",\"Dave and Buster's has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it. \\\\n\\\\nDining: 2 stars\\\\n\\\\nI had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \\\\n\\\\nWhen my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\\\\n\\\\nThe food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.\\\\n\\\\nBar: 1 Star\\\\n\\\\nDrinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\\\\n\\\\nArcade: 4 Stars\\\\n\\\\nThere are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOverall: 3 Stars\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.\",\"DO NOT ORDER THE HOT WINGS!! If you enjoy eating hot sauce flavored gravy paste, then by all means these are the wings for you. If not, stay away. My boyfriend and i each ate one and couldn't even finish the rest of our dinner. Don't waste your money!\",\"I've been here twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner, and I'd have to say that generally, I'm a fan.  Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.\\\\n\\\\nI came back for dinner a month or so later.  We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.  And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu.  But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.\\\\n\\\\nThe menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love.  Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy.  When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass.  We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.\\\\n\\\\nThings got better during the actual dinner.  I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  It's just squash!  But somehow, it was heavenly.  My friend enjoyed her Cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  I tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  The only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  Actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  I tasted them too, and I have to say - it was off-putting.  Perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  Fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.\\\\n\\\\nWe also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  I didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  I enjoyed our creme brulee - because I enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  \\\\n\\\\nOverall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  I had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  But this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  I think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal.\",\"Good fish sandwich.\",\"Love butter? Then get thee to Pierogies Plus.\\\\n\\\\nI live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer's freezer. Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.\\\\n\\\\nThe place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.\\\\n\\\\nOh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.\\\\n\\\\nYou also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.\\\\n\\\\nBesides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.\\\\n\\\\nAwesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.\\\\n\\\\nThe only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. A pierogi-less Allison is a cranky Allison.\",\"Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great.\",\"My sons a and I came for Tuesday Dollar Burger Night. You can gat a \\\\\\\"burger\\\\\\\" (beef, chicken, portabella, or turkey) in a bun with lettuce for a buck. Then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cents, veggies 50 cents, Artery Cloggers 75 cents, sauce 25 cents. Those are the headings and they have items listed under them-like 9 different cheeses. You can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well. \\\\nMy burger was $2.25 after I added toppings. Is it the best burger I've ever had? No. But is it the best $2.25 burger I've ever had?  Yes. It's kind if a Russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked. Mine was well done and one if my son's burger had pink in the middle. We probably could have sent it back but we don't mind a little pink. \\\\nI love the tater tots!  They are crispy and have the right amount of salt. Yummy!!\\\\nOur server was great and we'll definitely be back.\",\"We go here all the time and have ordered almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed. It's veggie diner food at it's best (at least in my opinion). My bf is a meat & potatoes man but he absolutely loves the breakfast  Homefries with tofu instead of eggs. The waitstaff have always been exceptionally nice and very attentive. This establishment is best described as a greasy spoon for vegans and vegetarians so if you go in expecting gourmet, you may find yourself disappointed.\\\\n\\\\nOn cold wintery days try a Mexican Hot Chocolate - it will surely warm your heart!\",\"I'm with Rachel C. on this one. You get an extra star for being a pretty Giant Eagle and a Cafe with a very decent beer selection of 6packs and individual bottles. Even though the Giant Eagle in Robinson is better in my opinion you, Waterfront Giant Eagle, are not bad and pretty close to where I live.\",\"The Kelly Strayhorn is a good idea which is poorly executed.  The facility has problems:  the stairs on the house are too narrow causing trips, the bathrooms don't really have the capacity for over 300 patrons, etc.\\\\n\\\\nBeyond the facility you get to the actual 'poorly executed' idea.  The staff is extremely un-knowledgeable about the subjects they are producing.  For instance none of the programmers on staff have any training in performing arts, they are all visual arts people playing at another field.  As a result they don't even know what they are really producing and any experienced person in the field can tell.  \\\\n\\\\nThe sad part about this is they REALLY try.  They throw staff and new ideas at every opportunity.  Don't expect great performances here, expect a talked up mediocre performance.  \\\\n\\\\nAudience follows content and they don't have content or the staff that is knowledgeable enough to know better.  Check back in in a couple of years.  This apple is too green to eat much less pay for.\",\"Mixed results.  Made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. Is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? Methinks not.  I had to ask to be moved to the patio, which was much better.\\\\n\\\\nThe drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. \\\\n\\\\nAppetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.  The texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right, sort of dry, maybe overcooked.  We had a bread pudding for dessert, which was probably the best part of the meal. I expect a better overall experience for the money.\",\"Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive!\",\"Absolutely Awful Service.  Went to Papa J's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly, rude and unhelpful..  Decided to try it again since it is close to Stage 62.  Big mistake.  Greeted by a dour manager that seemed mad that we had a reservation. 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  At one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  He said 'What do you want me to do about it?\\\\\\\" and said they had a busy night.  This is when tables around us sat empty. I then had to go back to the manager to give us our bill so we could get away from this ruined evening.  The bill was prepared incorrectly. If you want average food and terrible service, this is your place.  We will never go back.\",\"Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?\",\"I like this place but the hours are inconvenient (top roping doesn't open until 5PM during the week!!!!)

The drinks were on the pricey side, but I didn't head here to get smashed.\",\"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\\\\n\\\\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\\\\n\\\\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\\\\n\\\\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \\\\n\\\\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\\\\n\\\\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\\\\n\\\\nOh...but good food counts too. \\\\n\\\\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\\\\n\\\\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\\\\n\\\\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \\\\n\\\\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\\\\n\\\\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\\\\n\\\\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\\\\n\\\\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.\",\"I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront.  Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!  At least we didn't pay full price for the tickets.\",\"I went to this place because I had a LivingSocial voucher. Even with this voucher I feel like I paid too much money. I think I could have had better food if I went over to the Giant Eagle across the street and heated up a Lean Cuisine. I do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food.\\\\nThe only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. It was almost empty for a Monday at 7 PM, so if you are desperately starving, not able to go to better restaurants nearby or heat up food from your local grocer's freezer, this might be a tolerable food option.  Again, it is advisable to be desperately starving.\",\"I've been to Papa J's twice and had mixed experiences.\\\\n\\\\nBoth times I had the banana pepper appetizer, which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.\\\\n\\\\nFor entrees, me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.  I've had the fish sandwich (very good) and the eggplant parm sandwich (okay).  My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it, but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing. \\\\n\\\\nThe service is also a mixed bag.  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  The second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.  \\\\n\\\\nI would return to Papa J's, but I my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around Carnegie/Robinson.\",\"Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh was just \\\\\\\"okay\\\\\\\" for me. I really think that this place is geared towards children more so than adults or \\\\\\\"family\\\\\\\" because there isn't much fun here for people older than 16. The water slides here were lacking. There were very few of them and the majority of them are boring. The last time I was there (not too long ago) there weren't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide, so they really have some updating to do. \\\\n\\\\nThey do have an \\\\\\\"adult pool\\\\\\\" and bar area but it was so packed that it was hard to actually have fun in this area. The pool is very small, similar to one you'd find at a hotel chain. It has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max. and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in. It wasn't too impressive to me. \\\\n\\\\nThey also have a lazy river at this park and, while I do enjoy lazy rivers, this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe. People kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me grossed out. \\\\n\\\\nThe one attraction that I did enjoy was the wave pool. It was crowded as well but large enough to fit everybody comfortably. The water was nice and clean (a big plus) and the wave action was strong. I could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, this place is just mediocre. It doesn't \\\\\\\"wow\\\\\\\" me very much but if you live in the area, have kids, and are looking for somewhere to go in the summer other than the mall, it'll provide them with a lot of fun.\",\"I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\\\\n\\\\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\\\\n\\\\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.\",\"I definitely got the best service of the restaurants on Ellsworth from this restaurant, and they also offer the best food for the price.  \\\\n\\\\nThe menu is creative and dinner (soup, salad and salmon) were delicious, but there is nothing that Portugese about this place (except the decor and a very sweet older lady hostess who may in fact be Portugese).  In fact, I think it would be considered a national security threat in Portugal to have a place that serves dinner NOT serve wine.  The government of this state is partly to blame though.  Since when did PA become goddamn Utah?!  But Rendell's gotta get his cut I guess...\\\\n\\\\nAnyway, the place is small and intimate, one server handles the floor.  Minus points for the lack of alcohol,and frozen butter with the bread, but this restaurant is a neighborhood gem.\",\"I was visiting Pittsburgh and looking for a throat spray called Singers Saving Grace. Whole Foods didn't have the item in stock but East End Co-Op did! Also, had a smoothie while a shopped. \\\\n\\\\nWhat a great find!\",\"This place is great! Cute inside, great milkshake and hot and cold coffee drink options. We had the horchata was didn't taste exactly like horchata but was delicious. We ordered the bah mi which came with two types of fake meat on it. It wasn't a traditional tasting bah mi as it didn't have enough jalepanos, cilantro and it was much heavier but the bread was good and all in all it was a delicious sandwich. We also had the flower salad which comes with a heavy dose of kale and smoked tempeh. Really really good with the peanut dressing! Tempeh is soft and very flavorful. Will get again. Found out that they are closing/ moving to an unspecified location next week so we hope that they will be there on our next trip through Pittsburgh!\",\"Dear Shadow Lounge, \\\\nI miss you. You're wonderful in every way. The dance parties, the live music, the poetry slams, the local art, the totally reasonable drink prices, the cute and chill proprietor eye candy...I could go on. \\\\n\\\\nStay awesome. \\\\n\\\\nXoxo,\\\\nAndrea\",\"My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty \\\\\\\"meh\\\\\\\" experience for me.  We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought.  It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\\\\n\\\\nI went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here.  \\\\n\\\\nI just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.  Buffalo Blues was neither.\\\\n\\\\nNot particularly interested in returning for any reason.\",\"I am bummed about this- I had high hopes. Here's a rundown of the evening:\\\\n\\\\nPros:\\\\n- super friendly waitress, Stephanie, who maintained her professionalism and friendliness throughout \\\\n- yummy elderflower and pear beverage\\\\n- lobster bisque was nice and lobster-y\\\\n- hot delicious bread\\\\n\\\\nCons:\\\\n- oysters were sketch.

Stephanie brought us an order of East Coast oysters to replace the West Coast ones that we sent back.\\\\n- fresh grated horseradish had NO flavor or heat- what's up with that?\\\\n- scallops were meh- came with weird veggies, unevenly seared, and no real flavor.

We both took a half day at work and we arrived in the early afternoon (after lunch but before the dinner crowd). I can't say enough about this place...we have gone here on a few occasions and I've always been please with everything. \\\\n\\\\nPros: Nice friendly waitress, who took some time to take our picture (since it was our anniversary), food was excellent and not extremely overpriced, restaurant and bathrooms were clean!\\\\n\\\\nCons: None on this visit or any previous visits\",\"The food here is okay.  Wings, BBQ, Bar foods. The floor here is always super slippery.  It doesn't matter if I am wearing heels or sneakers.  I just don't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink.\",\"Tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold.  Will never order from here again.\",\"What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \\\\n\\\\\\\"Would you care for some dessert?\\\\\\\", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\\\\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\\\\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.\",\"Called for an arrangement for pickup, told the person who took my order that I would be able to pick the arrangement up at 5:30pm.  She asked if I could get there any earlier, I said I would try my best, but I work until 5pm, so maybe not.  She said ok.  \\\\n\\\\nComes to be 5pm and I get a call from a guy at the shop asking where I was!  The lady who took my order wrote down that I'd be there at 5pm.  I explained that I never said that and picked the arrangement up a little before 5:30pm.  \\\\n\\\\nArrangement was just OK.  I specifically wanted a lot of orange flowers, which they did, but they added strange colors with the orange... and some of the flowers were already a little wilted.  \\\\n\\\\nEven though the location is convenient, I will probably go elsewhere for a flower order next time.\",\"The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! \\\\n\\\\nOur waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   \\\\n\\\\nThe manager was really nice... Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn't eat was free.\",\"Went here this past Saturday afternoon, 11/2. My friends and I sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. The bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. As we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. We went next door to Mad Mex and got much better service!\",\"I personally enjoyed my recent visit to Bar Louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help. The restaurant is pricey for what it is, and our waitress was a bit lackluster.\\\\n\\\\nSo why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? Happy Hour and a nice patio!\\\\n\\\\nHappy Hour is on Monday-Friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 Drafts, $4 Wines, $5 Martinis, and 1/2 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads. My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us, and our bill was less than $40 total. Not bad!\\\\n\\\\nI ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini, and both were tasty. We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread. The food was also good, and I would order all three items again in the future.\\\\n\\\\nMy recommendation is to understand what Bar Louie is good at (Happy Hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times!\",\"I am very happy to be moving into a 'neighborhood' that has a line-up of decent mom-and-pop shops to find a reasonable meal when the cupboard is bare, or the energy banks are depleted for cooking. Bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and The Rusty Nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.\\\\n\\\\nIt's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. I've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.\\\\n\\\\nRusty Nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. In fact, I would imagine the Sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. As long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine. And indeed, all IS fine.\\\\n\\\\nSo few of our local 'diners' are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent 'diner' fare, that I can't call Rusty Nail a diner. It's a neighborhood family restaurant. Period.\\\\n\\\\nBurgers, meatloaf, pot roast, fish sammiches, salads, pastas...a varied but adequate menu. Fair and decent prices. Friendly and attentive service. A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. \\\\n\\\\nDuring my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!\\\\n\\\\nBottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood. \\\\n\\\\nBut do bring cash. The don't take credit cards. Believe it or not, they WILL actually take a check.\",\"Nice venue,  good food, great beer, awful service.  Staying at the Sheraton here I've patronized Bar Louie a dozen times recently and they screw up the order in some fashion every single time, without exception.\",\"We just completed our wedding registry at the Homestead location. The customer service was outstanding! One of the employees, Chris, walked around with us to help us pick out exactly what we needed. The wedding registry coordinator, Christina, was also very helpful and accommodating. They treated us as if we were royalty. I would recommend this wedding registry without a doubt!\",\"Hey, Jimmy! Cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags! The early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like second-hand smoke.\\\\nI had the same dish previously, without the special and it was fine (hence 2 stars and not 1). I'm going to avoid this place until I get a craving to drink tobacco.\",\"3.5 stars, actually. Would be 4 but I had to knock off half a star because of the parking situation. The lot sucks, I used to work at Whole Foods and I can not recall how many times I almost got hit by a car when retrieving carts. I am one of the lucky ones, I know of a few people who weren't so lucky. \\\\n\\\\nI'm a huge fan of the salad and hot bar - not a fan of the price though. To be fair, I can only blame myself for ending up with an $11 salad (but everything is so good and actually fresh I can't stop myself from piling it on). The prepared sandwich's are pretty awesome too and if you go after 9p, they are buy 1 get 1. \\\\n\\\\nI now work with a lot of children on special diets and I have no problem finding lots of GFCF treats for them here. \\\\n\\\\nGroceries range from expensive to moderate depending on the brand. The WFM's 365 line is an excellent bargain. \\\\n\\\\nThe bakery is full of tasty treats. You've gotta try the pumpkin pumpkin pie, though I believe it is only available around the holidays. \\\\n\\\\nThe whole store gets crazy busy on and around holidays.\",\"I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  I should kick myself for thinking of this place.\\\\n\\\\nGranted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already.  \\\\n\\\\nWhile sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The \\\\\\\"steakburger\\\\\\\" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.\\\\n\\\\nAll this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.\",\"Ah, Steak n Shake, you hit the spot after a night of drinking. Open 24 hours, drive thru or dine in, with wonderful, cheap greasy burgers, chicken fingers, breakfast sandwiches, and shoestring fries. You're faster (and cheaper!) than Eat N Park.

Granted, if we were at a fancy party, I might act like I don't know you, but deep down inside you know I heart you.\",\"I grew up just the street from Pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years, and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs. I've just been back for the first time in 6 years after moving away, and was pretty unimpressed... The decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really? It claimed to be \\\\\\\"fresh pasta,\\\\\\\" but it was completely tough and chewy (not \\\\\\\"al dente,\\\\\\\" just undercooked), and not very large. I'm not sure when the restaurant changed, but I think it really missed the mark... People WANT a casual, friendly, affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to. Why take that away?\",\"We were huge fans of Pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted. In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \\\\\\\" we have to get to Pinos!\\\\\\\" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.   Sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!!\",\"Service has always been good and the food consistent, we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and there's some great deals on drinks as well.\\\\n\\\\nThings that stand out to me: veggie wrap, fried zucchini, hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter, and house salad with ranch (their ranch is so good I could eat it with a spoon)\",\"I love the Improv. I think its a great way to start or spend a night! Nothing like a laughter filled night. I think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way (Owen Benjamin, Pablo Francisco super funny Tammy Pescatelli not so much.)\\\\n\\\\nThings you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks. I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive. Their service is spotty\\\\n\\\\nThe wait staff is a little iffy. I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity. If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it but this time I was like no way!\\\\n\\\\np.s. when I used my groupon I didn't have any trouble\",\"Great location!  I love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread.  Love love love the smiley cookies :)\",\"I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player, runner, and sports fan, so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas. With that said, this is probably the worst Dick's location that I've ever been to. The selection is very limited for soccer gear, which must be a testament to the lack of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear. It's mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players.\\\\n\\\\nThe staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it's the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don't have what we're looking for). \\\\n\\\\nThey do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you're looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn't have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a \\\\\\\"good\\\\\\\" Dick's location.\",\"Some how even though the food at this Eat'n Park is down right abominable, the smiles and laughter is always there.

The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.\\\\n\\\\nTonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.\\\\n\\\\nI imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.\\\\n\\\\nWhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?\\\\n\\\\nThe food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.\\\\n\\\\nWe certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.\",\"Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience.\",\"Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old, cold, hard, inedible.  Sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish. I can't even believe that the server, let alone the  \\\\\\\"chef\\\\\\\" thought it appropriate to serve. \\\\n\\\\nBrought my 2 year old along, had to get a high chair, I'm able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one.\",\"Nothing matches in this place! The tables, the chairs, the tiles and that's how we like it! Lots of delicious vegan items. Definitely a good place to try new things. Good coffee too!\",\"For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.\",\"Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.\\\\n\\\\nNOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.\",\"Food poisoning a la Tomato Bisque Soup.\\\\n\\\\nForever skeptical.\\\\n\\\\nThat's too bad, I don't mind paying extra for better produce or better brands. But, I KIND OF mind getting extremely sick, so sick that anything I ever would vouch for goes down the toilet, with my vomit.\",\"Rocky's has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong.  Their food is good.  Not haute cuisine, pretentious!  Everyday, well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking.  I've mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room, but, today I introduced an old friend to \\\\\\\"linner\\\\\\\" in the bar.\\\\nHe ordered the large version of fish sandwich.  Rocky's is famous for their fish.  Three large breaded and fried fish filets, bun and fries for under $10.  Needless to say, he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate.\\\\nI ordered the meatball grill.  It was delish.  Served on thick cut Italian bread and made \\\\\\\"grilled cheese\\\\\\\" (mozzarella) style.  Meatballs and tomato sauce are both good!  Also, served with fries.  I brought home half the sandwich.\\\\nAnother good meal there.  Friends, mother, and former boss all enjoy their food!\",\"Can be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  We had a cheese tasting simply because I *never* pass up Pleasant Ridge Reserve when given the opportunity.  They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove.  Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...\\\\n\\\\nService was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.\",\"Chuckie Cheese for grown ups...Yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but I'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).\\\\n\\\\nFirst let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.\\\\n\\\\nThe building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.\\\\n\\\\nI will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first.\",\"Got the rancho and the Greek, not so bad but I probably won't go back... Too heavy for me...\",\"For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\\\\n\\\\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\\\\n\\\\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \\\\\\\"right out.\\\\\\\"  While I guess she didn't define \\\\\\\"right out,\\\\\\\" what this actually meant was \\\\\\\"in 25 minutes.\\\\\\\"  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\\\\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\\\\n\\\\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\\\\n\\\\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \\\\\\\"Mac and Cheese\\\\\\\", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\\\\n\\\\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \\\\\\\"just the bill.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with \\\\\\\"I hope you will join us again.\\\\\\\" I will not.\",\"I'm not too impressed with this particular Dick's Sporting Goods. It is in a great location in the Waterfront, but the selection seems a bit limited to me. They have what you need, but they don't have many options it seems.\\\\n\\\\nI went in there the other day and it looks like they also have a snowboarding section now, which they definitely did not have last season. They also have hunting, golfing and biking, in addition to the other regular deptartments. \\\\n\\\\nYour normal Dick's. Nothing spectacular, but it will do.\",\"I ate here this past Sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend.  I have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside.  We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.\\\\n\\\\nFor my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet.  Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy.  My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza.  Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.\\\\n\\\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Everything that I tasted was good and I would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast.\",\"Good food, great service, but high prices.\\\\n\\\\nMy date and I shared 2 appetizers, a salad and each had an entree with the recommended wine pairings. Bill was $115 without tax--pricey by my standards for this experience. The new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night. The bruschetta with fig and grape butter, prosciutto and blue cheese was good, so was the beet salad.\\\\n\\\\nWe were disappointed with our entrees. My roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot. My date had the salmon with potato fennel puree, which she said tasted fishy.\\\\n\\\\nMake sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough I would come here again, there are certainly much better restaurants in the city. I would rank Casbah below Eleven within the Big Burrito group of restaurants.\",\"I've been here quite a few times, and I always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near Pitt. They have a ton of nice HDTVs.\\\\n\\\\nEverytime I go, there is always a weird taste to one (or more) of the beers that I get. I was just there for the Pitt/Oakland game and got a Redhook. I drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. Its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\\\\n\\\\nThe food is hit or miss. I got the French onion soup last time. It was good. Nothing ground breaking, but solid soup. I've had the pork nachos and they were blah.\",\"Food glorious foooood, hot sausage and MUStard...\\\\n\\\\nActually they don't sell hot sausage and mustard but, you know. \\\\n\\\\nThey do have amazing ham and cheese sandwiches, that are kinda pricy, but oh so good. And if you want them, you better get there early on the weekend! They're small, so get 2 for yourself at least :)\\\\n\\\\nWe've also tried the Nutella tart, which i've had twice now because it's SO DELICIOUS. The fruit tart is not bad, cinnamon buns are great, jewish pizza is ok (not what I was expecting - it's kinda like a fruitcake - like the dreaded holiday kind - but denser and drier), strata (eggy bread dish) which was pretty good, key lime cake - so so good, and quiche (good). \\\\n\\\\nSeating is hit or miss, since there's only a few tables (3 of them seat 4 people, 1 seats 2 people). On a quieter morning you should be able to find a seat. They serve coffee as well (nothing to write home about), $2 a cup, but if you like coffee with your dessert like me, it's nice to have.\",\"Surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight.   First time at this location.  Great service, but wasn't hard to do.....\\\\n\\\\nHad a combination Orange Shrimp and Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice.  It was typical PF Changs (Very good).  You can get the Fried Rice off the kids menu for $2.95 versus $8 for a big bowl off the regular menu.\",\"Ugh. Dirty. Long lines.

The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time.

However, we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini.

Half-price apps make for a cheap, but nice, dinner and a movie - great, great specials. However, I would not buy a full-priced dinner here.

Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(\",\"This place used to have a great bar/tapas menu with a decent selection of happy hour wine specials.  Now...  not so much.  Well, during HH, you can get any of the wines under $10 for $5.  Selection by the glass is limited.  \\\\n\\\\nAs for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  I haven't really been disappointed yet!  The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends.  The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  \\\\n\\\\nOh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!

For $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  The smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  The truffled potato was yummy.  The arugula salad was as delicious as ever!  And for entree, we both got the Casbah benedict.  I have to admit that neither of us was blown away, but it was good and filling.  I think that we will both be back to try other things on the menu!\",\"Nothing special. Just like Applebee's, Chili's or Fridays.

You get three sliders and they were very good.\\\\n\\\\nMy wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\\\\n\\\\nOur daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.\\\\n\\\\nI ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste.

However, their store hours are absolutely terrible. Closing at 7pm basically means they're never open when I would need to go there.

I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  \\\\n\\\\nMy two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \\\\n\\\\nThe service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  \\\\n\\\\nAdded bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).\",\"Old school.....traditional \\\\\\\"mom 'n pop\\\\\\\" quality and perfection.

Its hodge podge decor and hipster crowd are what drew me here in the first place, but turns out the food and coffee is pretty decent even delicious. Since it's far from where I live I don't get to come here half as often as I'd like but I'm always pleased when I do. \\\\n\\\\nSuch cute boys.\",\"It's fun, but not as fun as Kennywood. The boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes on/shoes off events. The lazy river could be much better. I did like the water slides and the Potato Patch fries, as well as the scenic location.\",\"I am definitely the salt queen.  I literally salt everything from pizza, McDonalds French Fries (even though I know that they already have tons of salt on them).  I also salt ham and processed foods.   I always salt food before even tasting it.  Nothing is off limits when it comes to me and my salt shaker.\\\\n\\\\nWell when my beautiful meal arrived I asked my server for the salt.  None of the tables had salt or pepper shakers on them.  As my server went to get me the salt shaker, I took a bite of my potatoes.  Whoa!!!!!  They were extremely salty!!!!   For the first time in my life,  I didn't add any additional salt to my meal.  For me to say something is \\\\\\\"very\\\\\\\" salty.... It is very salty. \\\\n\\\\nBeing the salt queen,  I stll  was able to enjoy and love my meal.  I am almost guarantee that the average person would not have enjoyed this food..  My friend also tasted my meal and immediately noticed the heavy taste of salt.  However he never salts anything so something with one grain of salt on it, he will be about to tell.  \\\\n\\\\nIt really suprised me that such an upscaled restaurant would have this much salt added to their food.  I am sure that it was an error or something.  I have eaten here in the past and never experience so much salt.\\\\n\\\\nStill my meal \\\\\\\"for me\\\\\\\" was delicious.  For the first time in my life, I am glad that I did not add any salt to my meal.\\\\n\\\\n  I do love Casbah alot.  It is probably my second favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.\",\"I'm not into waterparks as much as I am into amusement parks.  I go to Sandcastle maybe once a year.  But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.  The main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the Sandbar and the Sandbar Pool and the Hot Tub remain open for the 21 and over set.  The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  Occasionally there's live entertainment.\\\\n\\\\nIt's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works.  But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.  There's even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.\\\\n\\\\nI'm glad I renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully, I'll get another chance to come back.\",\"My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon.\",\"Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  Seriously, I'd rather eat at the OG.\",\"Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped in simply because the Brugge was full, but I unfortunately won't be making that mistake again.\",\"Will I come here again?  Yes absolutely for drinks, they knocked the Ketel One extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park.  The ambiance is very nice.  Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt \\\\\\\"bad where I hope they improve.\\\\\\\"  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  We went with appetizers she recommended.  Not good.  \\\\n\\\\nSeared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  NOT good.  With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  The chef should do so.  (He's a nice guy like me I hope.)  \\\\n\\\\nBBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It is chilled, very delicious.  This appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce.  A real \\\\\\\"must-miss\\\\\\\".  \\\\n\\\\nCod entree was OK.  The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  Potato skin had grit in the mashed.  Why 1 star?  The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine.  I hope they spruce it up.  The place is nice.\",\"Great club/bar/lounge/venue. Great mix of people and music with decent bartenders and good prices on beer.\",\"I came here with a friend for her birthday, and the food really isn't particularly special.  Portions are decent, and I guess the prices are reasonable... if they had better food. \\\\n\\\\nThe outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring, but the inside patio area was pretty nice actually.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I just wasn't very impressed with the food.  If I was offered to eat this food for free, sure, I'd take a helping, but probably not seconds.\",\"The Quiet Storm was great. I started with the soup of the day which was something along the lines of a carrot pumpkin curry. It had an unexpected texture but I still quite enjoyed it. For my entr\\\\u00e9e I had the Spinach Burger, which was quite filling. It is quite unique and comes with plenty of options for toppings. I couldn't resist putting cheese on the otherwise vegan burger, but still felt very healthy eating such a veggie-filled dinner! Their milkshakes also looked amazing - I would have tried one but I needed something to warm me up instead so I got a latte, which was also very good. One other thing I thought was neat was that the sell mixers and encourage you to bring your own champagne and/or vodka. I haven't seen that before, but it's a great idea!\\\\n\\\\nI was also intrigued by some of the other items on the menu, so I will need to go back to try more.\",\"Never received my order and was left in a bad mood. The driver did not carry GPS for delivery, did not know my address which is right in squirrel hill, did not listen to me (or did not understand me?) when I tried to give him directions, asked me to pick up food from an intersection 0.3 miles away from my apartment in snow, and finally yelled at me to cancel my order. \\\\n\\\\nCannot comment about food, but whatever experience I had left a bad taste.\",\"I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \\\\\\\"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \\\\\\\"chain\\\\\\\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \\\\\\\"bar-straunt\\\\\\\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).\\\\n\\\\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\\\\n\\\\nI've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\\\\n\\\\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.\",\"I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \\\\\\\"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\\\\\\\".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.\",\"Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service\",\"Nice place but some of the items on the menu are not available unless you get a 2 for 12 but that's not what the online menu states. And it's a salad come on..\",\"I don't frequent Bar Louie, and I really don't plan to change that any time soon. I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place.\\\\n\\\\nThe food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never \\\\\\\"wowed\\\\\\\" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\\\\n\\\\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.\\\\n\\\\nSo while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon.\",\"I guess I'm getting burned out on winter.  That's what made me think about this place.  See, as Julina below says, it's close to Frick Park and it's a wonderful place to pick up sandwiches, pop, or picnic supplies before going over there.  It's also a great place to sit outside with a cup of coffee or a cold drink or snack before going over to the Frick Mansion.  So you can stop here with your out-of-town guests while sightseeing.\\\\n\\\\nThis is truly a little out-of-the-way gem, located on a side street.  I haven't been up this way in awhile (I was also nosing around on Google Maps/Street View yesterday, so that's also why I thought of this place) so I hope nothing much has changed here.\",\"This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money, shop elsewhere.\",\"Talk about overpriced. $18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it. The latter was terrible, thin and flabby and rather unappealing. The pasta itself was ok, as was the sauce. The desserts are pretty good. But honestly, that is a $10 dish whose price has been inflated.\",\"Good beer selection. Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd, it wasn't her fault she was the only server. But it took about an hour to get our sandwiches. Mine was one of the best reubens I've ever had.\",\"If you must eat at Eat N Park, this is the one you want to go to. Why you ask? The corporate offices are right next door and the suits are there every day, breakfast lunch and dinner. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I spend a few hours with dear old mom, she enjoyed spending a day at the Waterfront, she loved the since closed 39 center store, where she could buy her monthly greeting cards for 39 cents each. Then we drive over to this eat n park where she has her breakfast smile and I enjoy an egg beater sandwich and fresh fruit.\\\\n\\\\nThis place is spotless, the salad bar always looks fresh and the food is good, for a chain.\",\"I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it!\",\"Closed.  Signage down.  Boarded up tight.  Phone disconnected.\",\"I haven't been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \\\\n\\\\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \\\\\\\"I have to go back for the rest.\\\\\\\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \\\\n\\\\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\\\\n\\\\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won't deter me from returning.\",\"If you have any common sense at all, please don't stay here.  Once, it almost burnt down...and I'm pretty sure most of the locals were chanting \\\\\\\"burn, baby, burn.\\\\\\\"\",\"I really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  First, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  I'm writing this review after going there twice.  The first time my husband and I went, the dinner was good.  We thought this place has the potential to be our go-to Chinese restaurant in Pgh.  Today I remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  The won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  The entree was fine.  \\\\n\\\\nWhat really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  The smell wouldn't leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as I could) to get rid of the smell.  Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?  \\\\n\\\\n[first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]\",\"It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  Everyone in the table resented me for \\\\\\\"holding back\\\\\\\" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.\\\\n\\\\nWhich hey works as a segway onto the burger.  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways.  The patty was sorta flavorful.  The toppings were in the bland category.  Cheese went MIA.  And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.\\\\n\\\\nA big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits.\",\"Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order.\",\"OMG who wrote the review below? A big fat liar/someone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls, and squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, so not the best, but for two hours, we could deal. We looked for bed bugs, and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest. After about 20-30 minutes, we both started itching like crazy. I ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders, arms, and legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut them down! It's deplorable in there!!\",\"This place is so hit-or-miss for me. Sometimes the food is amazing; sometimes it is terrible. Example: I ordered the spicy peanut wrap for the first time and fell in love with it. I came back a couple weeks later, and it was bland and unappetizing. Maybe there is someone who works in the kitchen who doesn't know where the spice rack is-- I don't know.\\\\n\\\\nThe 'waitstaff' is hit-or-miss, too. Sometimes, they're great. Other times, I've waited for ages just for a menu. One guy actually snapped at me for asking for a breakfast item at lunch. \\\\n\\\\nThat said, there are some good dishes, like the Black & Gold. I like that in some dishes you can replace rice with salad. A lot of people I've eaten with here have raved about the quesadillas. There's a nice laid back atmosphere and fun retro diner decor. There's also an extensive (but expensive) drinks menu with milkshakes, teas and coffee drinks, and a nice selection of locally-made vegan sweets and pastries. And I love the magazine and book rack, even though the magazines are usually two years old.

cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable, and there are no fitting rooms!  One purchases clothes at their own risk!  What person would buy a suit under these conditions, hoping the pants will fit?  Unlike other stores, there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted, a rare cash only business.  To the reviewer who boasts that everything is 50% off every day, how is that a sale?  It is bogus pricing.  Red White and Blue, uggh!\",\"I would rather drive out of my way to another Home Depot than give this location my business. \\\\n\\\\nEmployees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them. Strike that... I'm certain they notice, they just don't care.\\\\n\\\\nI'm a pretty understanding person, but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit, it's time to go. There are plenty of HD's around, seek them out and skip this one (especially if you're going to have questions)!\",\"After further consideration, this store does not deserve a 4 star review. The Old Navy product has been pretty weak recently, which isn't the store's fault, but the severe lack of customer service doesn't help the situation. \\\\n\\\\nWhile shopping here on Friday, I was one of maybe 3-5 people in the store. I would practically walk into a sales associate but not even receive a glance or smile. No one working here seems to give an iota whether or not product is being sold. To avoid inconveniencing the associates, I will be taking my Old Navy purchases online in the future.\",\"This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here.\",\"I love bed bath & beyond! \\\\n\\\\nThe employees at this particular one are always available and helpful!  \\\\n\\\\nThe selection, plus the 20% off coupons keep me coming back, and its also where I get all of the things for my soda stream. \\\\n\\\\nOverall I will be back many, many times\",\"Waterfront Lowe's beats Monroeville Lowe's for lawn and garden.  Hate to admit it, but it's true.\",\"This local Lowe's serves its purpose for my husband and me -- a convenient home improvement store that we run into every month or two. I am most impressed by the lawn and garden section of the store. I am not sure how it compares to other Lowe's stores, but when shopping at the Home Depot in North Fayette last fall, their flower selection was dismal compared to this Lowe's.\",\"I mean, it's Target. It has everything. You just need to know what to buy there, and not get sucked into the convenience of buying everything in one spot.\\\\n\\\\nBeware -- though their merchandise looks nice, and it's a good buy for a student, you don't want to make long-term purchases here. The zipper on a skirt I bought broke the first time I wore it. I've heard horror stories about disintegrating comforters during their first wash.\\\\n\\\\nThat said, their store-brand toiletries and other sundry items are fairly cheap, and they have a wider selection than Giant Eagle or CVS. They also have a cool program with Flickr.com -- you can upload your photos, order them online from Target's One-Hour Photo kiosk, and pay by credit card when you pick them up.\\\\n\\\\nI love their cheap accessories -- glasses, bags, jewelry. Along with Claire's and Filene's, Target is my favorite place to shop for those things.\",\"Never again. Let me repeat, never again. \\\\n\\\\nThe primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\\\\n\\\\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \\\\\\\"guilty-until-proven guilty\\\\\\\" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\\\\n\\\\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.\\\\n\\\\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \\\\\\\"maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\\\\\\\"  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\\\\n\\\\nThe latest of many \\\\\\\"adventures\\\\\\\" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  \\\\n\\\\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they \\\\\\\"found\\\\\\\" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.  Hence, I am now here, writing this review.\\\\n\\\\nNever, ever again.\",\"Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff.\",\"Love the store. Great stuff, High price. Buyer BEWARE of the RUDE cashier SYLVIA, extremely unpleasant, unwilling to help and always with NEGATIVE attitude. She needs customer service training....Someone please tell her to stop complaining about other customers or employees....Cashier that does window display is always kind, friendly and helpful.\",\"Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.\\\\n\\\\nI will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.\\\\n\\\\nSo I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. \\\\n\\\\nI went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. \\\\n\\\\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\\\\n\\\\nSo I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying \\\\\\\"Soooo, you DON'T want these???\\\\\\\" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! \\\\n\\\\nAfter that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). \\\\n\\\\nThe thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever.\",\"Fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things.  I mean I know how to swing a hammer and push a button to start a machine, but all the other stuff...meh.\\\\n\\\\nI've only really gone in here to pick up paint, so I'll focus on that.  I feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter.  Each time I'm in there she always seems to be by herself with a line of customers all wanting there base paint tinted.  I don't believe there was ever a time I could just walk up to the counter and have my paint mixed for me.  Give that woman a hand.\",\"The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. \\\\n\\\\nI stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. \\\\n\\\\nPlus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront. I'd recommend checking other craft stores first. Unless you need glitter. Especially fine glitter. Michael's has the best glitter selection/quality of any store I've ever been to.\",\"Very bad purchase experience. I bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves, but they denied my request to return it. I am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore.\",\"Simply the best thrift store I've ever been to. Well worth the 3 1/2 hour drive from my hometown.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, and foremost, EVERYTHING IS 1/2 off all of the time!\\\\n\\\\nSecondly, bring cash. They DO NOT accept credit cards.\\\\n\\\\nThe store is full of wonderful pieces of clothing, all arranged by color and type (not by size, which is unfortunate). I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to high-end business attire to super-trendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful; Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, H&M. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the 80s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!\\\\n\\\\nThe clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plus-sized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.\\\\n\\\\nI went to Red White & Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of $7!\\\\n\\\\nCome to this thrift store; it'll make all other shopping obsolete!\",\"I love this place!  You never know what your going to find!  They have all kinds of things, that are usually slavaged from a home or business.   Kitchen cabinets, tables, mantels, windows, doors, tons of doors!   If your some one who likes to fix old things or make new things out of old stuff, you must go here!  I picked up an old dresser today for $10 its needs the drawer fixed and to be refinished, but when its done its going to look beautiful!  They have old appliances , bathroom sinks and toilets, lighting fixtures, wood, paint, counter tops, flooring materials, some tile, etc., etc.!\",\"Prices not great for true thrifters. Staff completely useless. No dressing rooms. I simply have nothing to say about this place.\",\"I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because another laundry place put me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs.  I thought the late hours alone should give it a star. Then I had this experience\\\\n\\\\n--Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. \\\\n\\\\n---- misleading advertising it boasts \\\\\\\"high capacity\\\\\\\" washers an says its air conditioned, well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were dripping in black dust and look like they were installed in 1963. which might have been why I felt an instant asthma attack coming on. \\\\n\\\\nThen the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting. Then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at 1030-11:00  pm at night so I can only Imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours. \\\\n\\\\nThen there was this guy I guess he was an attendant or the owner, he was wiping down the machines and dryers. I was moving my clothes out of the dryer and I had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer. I was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched them!!\\\\n\\\\nUgh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes. \\\\n\\\\nI come back in to check on drying clothes.... and what do I find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat. Now I am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load. All in all I spent 8$ at the econowash for 2 large loads I wasn't able to do my third load in the washers he had for under that. I can do that much at Laundry Factory around the corner though. So I will be going there. I don't need a creepy dude changing my dryer settings and touching my stuff.\",\"This place is bright and clean and I've seen staff taking care of machines every time I've been there (different times/different days) so I imagine it's well maintained in general.  Love that there are bus stops directly in front of and across the street AND that this is a 24-hour place.  I usually spend $7.50 every 2 weeks* though I could probably get away with using the single load machines and a few minutes less in the dryer.  I especially appreciate the good spin cycle from these washers as that means less time it has to be in the dryer!\\\\n\\\\nAround here, you can walk around the 'hood while waiting for your cycle to finish (pizza place, convenience store, coffee/ice cream shops next door, Border's bookstore down the block, more shops on Ellsworth nearby)\\\\n\\\\n*I'm a female doing laundry for 1 so it takes a while to have enough for separate whites/color load.  I've also been to The Laundry Factory a few blocks away and I prefer Econowash over The Laundry Factory.\",\"So I came to this Red White and Blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca, and I will get to how I left empty handed and in tears.  First, I'll walk you through my experience. \\\\n This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! \\\\nI couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). \\\\n\\\\nI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  \\\\nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.\",\"This is a bizarre CVS, the kind you would only want to go to in a pinch, and maybe not even then.\\\\n\\\\nI went to this one with my husband a couple of times to pick up prescriptions, and the vibe from start to finish is so weird. Let's start with parking, which is in a lot behind the store. There's not a lot of visibility to the lot since it is on the back side of the CVS. Being that it is a pharmacy, there wouldn't be a back door or windows, so the lot has a feeling of dangerous seclusion.\\\\n\\\\nInside the store, everything I saw told me that \\\\\\\"this is a pharmacy that is in a rough neighborhood\\\\\\\": shelves are only about 4'6\\\\\\\" tall (presumably so workers can see what people are doing in the aisles); bizarre things are locked in cabinets with clear covers (regular brands of shampoo?!); beauty items regularly updated, weren't (I, er, have a nail polish problem; some of the products were about 4 seasons behind and quite a few polishes were separated); it feels like there isn't enough room for the products, which are disorganized and crammed onto shelves (reference the odd shelf height limitation).\\\\n\\\\nIf you can spare the gas and time, there is another a CVS on Center Ave within a mile or so or a Walgreen's (Penn Circ S+Trade St.) and a Rite Aid (Baum+Negley) within 1/2 mile.\",\"nice and clean with well organized large selection but was expensive. I was looking for some twin size thin cotton blankets easy to wash and hang dry for my dog and the prices were $14.99 of course somewere high quality items which u would have to pay new retail store price $40-50 but still overpriced. I finally found a small blanket for $7 on sale.\",\"I can't believe I've been here multiple times and haven't reviewed it yet.  I absolutely love this place.  It's a super thrift store if you will.\\\\n\\\\nNo matter when I come here, I always find something.  It quite the experience.  I always make sure it's a day when I am off of work because I can literally spend hours here just looking.  It's a good thing that I do this, you can't just show up here and think that you will be able to gran an item and then leave.  \\\\n\\\\nLike a fellow reviewer said, there are not fitting rooms here, so be prepared to walk into someone trying on a potential great new garment for them self in the middle of an aisle.  Sometimes you just can't avoid this, I blame the fact that they have mirrors set up throughout stores.\\\\n\\\\nThey have everything you can seem to desire here.  Clothing to electronics, furniture to bedding, books to movies.  EVERYTHING is under this roof.\\\\n\\\\n*Cash only, ATM on premise.\",\"I love this store. I can just spend hours walking around getting ideas of things to either update or change around my house.\\\\n\\\\nAll of the sales associates are very helpful and knowledgeable. Sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you because they are busy helping other customers.\\\\n\\\\nThey even cut keys that actually work.\",\"Watch out when it looks like something is on sale.  They mark a rack or table with a big buy one get one or 50% off sign, then only some of the stuff on the rack is on sale.\",\"This store has changed hands many times over the past few years and it shows. Fifteen years ago if you didn't get there by 9am you would have fight a crowd. Now it never seems all that busy. Many of the store's best and dedicated employees left or were let go (about five years ago) and product lines change with each new owner. The most recent owner seems to be improving the store and employee turnover has seemed to slow.\",\"Oh Target!  You are big corporate America!  But how can I not love you so?

I went here after a dinner date with some neighbors and couldn't believe how packed it was. We had to wait 10 minutes just to find enough chairs to seat 4 people. We ended up stealing them from other tables. Not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minutes just to get an Ice tea lemonade.\\\\n\\\\nSo amidst all the books, newspapers and magazines they have an audio and video section. The prices aren't anything to rave about. I can buy the same movies online for a lot cheaper there's just the waiting period. I do shop here sometimes for there discount books. I found a lot of great recipe and mystery books for really cheap, like under $5. That's a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who has a great selection of books for literally half the price of retailers, how can you beat those prices. \\\\n\\\\nB&N is more of a hangout spot with books in case you want to buy one right there and then. But everything is kind of confusing you always need to ask where something is. I'd rather shop online for anything i really want. It's just not worth it to buy it wholesale.\",\"I have been frequently shopping at this Michaels store over the last couple months since I began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home. The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.\\\\n\\\\nI do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money! Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. \\\\n\\\\nMy only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location. I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon. The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register. Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers, it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient....\",\"Ever shopped at a Thrift Shop that sells high end labels, some brand new and gently used items like backpacks for $5? This is a great place to discover unique things. They also have daily deals such as 1/2 off of certain color tags. Have to dig through other things though to find something interesting which is part of the adventure!\",\"I love a deal, and this has been my favorite thrift store since I was a kid.  \\\\n\\\\nFirst, there is some sort of half-off deal every day.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, the used book selection is pretty decent.  Yeah, there are a ton of self-help and Patterson mass markets that you have wade through, but T.C. Boyle for two bucks?  Yes, please.\\\\n\\\\nThird, the home goods.  I've gotten huge solid wood picture frames for only a couple dollars.  The art prints inside were hideous...but I threw those away, re-stained the frames to my liking, cut new mats, and inserting art quoted as $360 each to frame at a big chain fabric store for under $30.  Boom.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, there is a decent selection of lamp to re-wire, always lot of furniture, some diamond in the rough clothes on occasion, and lots of other wacky stuff that's just fun to sift through.\\\\n\\\\nCASH ONLY and the cashiers are pretty rude/lazy, but that never bothers me.\\\\n\\\\nBONUS:  They pick up your donations for free from your porch.  http://www.pickupplease.org/  Super easy.\",\"Target is one of my favorite stores -- I just love wandering around late at night when the store is quiet -- it's just so therapeutic! This location is now my closest store, so I drop by pretty often.\\\\n\\\\nThis store is pretty average. Inventory and customer service aren't particularly stellar but isn't poor either. I've generally been able to find what I need here and check out pretty quickly. \\\\n\\\\nIn addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most Targets, this location also has an optical department. Of the 10-15 locations in the Pittsburgh area, only this store and the Cranberry store sell glasses. I purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses through Target Optical three years ago and have been very happy with their product and customer service.\",\"Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.

Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. \\\\n\\\\nABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon.\",\"What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot?  It used to be my \\\\\\\"go-to\\\\\\\" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  \\\\n\\\\nI stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not \\\\\\\"qualified\\\\\\\" for delivery to the store.  \\\\\\\"When will the items be restocked?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Don't know.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.\\\\\\\"  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.

Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  \\\\n\\\\nThe East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  \\\\n\\\\nVERY disappointing to me.\",\"Hats?

Twice in the last two weeks, I've washed loads of laundry late at night and discovered my dryer hasn't worked. It's really great to know that this place is right down the street and is open 24/7, especially when the Laundry Factory down the street closes at about 9pm (which in general I much prefer to this place). But for convenience-sake, I appreciate this place. On the cons list, it's not incredibly clean and I have used dryers that simply don't work here.\",\"This was my first time to this Home Depot.  Very impressed with the customer service here.  We were redoing a bathroom and went in for more tiles.  They were out of them.  However, a staff member helped us use other tile and decorative pieces to compliment the tile we already had, instead of schlepping all the way to Monroeville to pick up the tile up were originally looking for.  We were very happy with the result!\",\"For someone who straddles the line between sometimes craft-er, this store can seem vast and confusing.

(Do it yourself) if you didn't already know that. I enjoy building, maintaining and fixing things in my own home as opposed to hiring a contractor and paying a boat load. I'm best known at the Home Depot in monroeville. I come in there so often a lot of the employees know me just by my dog. Yes my dog, who i have brought into this store several times. They allow pets i'm assuming because i've never been asked to leave and I've seen others with their pets as well. \\\\n\\\\nThat's the best part about the store is the animal policy and the fact that they offer enough supplies for you to practically build a house. Some things are cost efficient while others are kinda breaking the bank. There not as modern as lowes but they have alot of the same products. I recently built my own in home bar. t's 8 by 2, a long bar that i (a girl) built by hand. I'm very proud of the work i did.

With a 1920s house, I spend quite a bit of time here for getting materials for repairs.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer service is about average. Some people are very helpful, others not so much. In general, they seem to be better than the Lowes at the Waterfront. At least HD people know where items are in the store. I can't tell you how many times I've received completely different (and wrong) answers to finding stuff at Lowes.\\\\n\\\\nI would prefer a small hardware store (such as an Ace) closer to me for things like nuts, bolts, and screws. Ace seems to have a better selection than HD does for hard-to-find items. HD has most of the basics covered, however, and probably a little cheaper.\\\\n\\\\nI generally avoid their paint section except for equipment. I prefer the service at a Sherwin-Williams or Masterwork Paint store. \\\\n\\\\nWe've had decent luck with their garden department. We've had to return a few plants that died the day after we planted them, but they have never given us any problems with returns. \\\\n\\\\nIt's a big-box home improvement store, for better or worse.

Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day.

Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.\\\\n\\\\nAt Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you \\\\\\\"You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!\\\\\\\" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.\\\\n\\\\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.\",\"I love love LOVE this store.

I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It's such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. \\\\n\\\\nSo the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find.

Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited.\\\\n\\\\nThe clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue.

Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. \\\\n\\\\nShopping here is a gold find!!

Like another reviewer says, you have to watch the impulse buying here because it is so easy to do!\\\\n\\\\nBut as for the name brands here, I've never had a problem with them.  I bought some Woolrich blankets and sheets here that my husband and I have been very satisfied with.  The housewares section here is positively unbeatable.  My husband Rick is an amateur chef and he could blow his paycheck on the kitchen utensils.  He particularly likes the Michael Graves ones.  He is also an amateur photographer and he still works with film, so he likes the film development here.\\\\n\\\\nMe, I also like buying household cleaners and personal items such as soaps, toothpaste, deoderant, etc because the selection is so good.  I've also purchased a lot of my casual wear here.\",\"Barnes & Noble, it's like the Wal-Mart of bookstores.  Beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike.  \\\\n\\\\nI'm not quite sure whether I'm in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a CD shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.  With all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge it's a bit hard to figure it out.  Feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.\\\\n\\\\nI don't know about y'all, but I'd rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this.\",\"I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. \\\\n\\\\nI had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that? Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? \\\\n\\\\nThese people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. \\\\n\\\\nTheir professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic.\",\"Typical, but new.  \\\\n\\\\nYou see all of the people that are walking in and out and, I must say, the customers look like they work for a living hear.  I swear one of the guys was covered head to toe in soot.  That is amazing.  \\\\n\\\\nRan around the store looking for those few items that I needed to satisfy my need to build and create.  Minimal help from the small quantities of employees, but some of them actually asked if I needed help -- after I had found the item.\",\"As far as I'm concerned, Filene's Basement is good for two things: cheap dresses and cheap accessories.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs a young performer, I need good-looking dresses for frequent auditions -- and I need a couple, so I'm not wearing the same thing every time. The dresses on the second floor usually range from $30-60 and are good for over a year. It can be hard to find a full-length dress that's not reminiscent of a prom dress, but their selection of cocktail-length dresses is ample.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs far as accessories go, Filene's tends to have cheap versions of popular trends. If I feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad, Filene's is the place to go.\",\"If you're looking for a wallet, a new cheap purse or something of that nature--this is the place to go.\\\\n\\\\nOtherwise, this kind of shopping just isn't for me!\\\\nI don't have the patience for clothes shopping here though.\\\\nThe racks drive me nuts bc they're in no particular order.\\\\n\\\\nIts \\\\\\\"Shirts/Sizes\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Pants/Sizes\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Jeans/Sizes\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Coats/Sizes\\\\\\\"\\\\nI can't look through a gazillion racks of shirts looking for something I like (aimlessly) in a M or L...

If I wanted to know I'd ask !!!\",\"I go to this CVS all the time, since I work in the neighborhood.  I'm not a huge fan of it - I go mostly due to convenience.  Their greeting card selection is kind of lousy - I don't think I've ever found a decent card here.  I keep trying, every holiday or birthday, but every section is just full of duds.  Also, a lot of stuff is locked behind panels that you need the employees to unlock.  Like, razor blades.  And body wash.  BODY WASH?  It drives me nuts that I need to ask someone to open that shelf for me.  It makes no sense.  Staff is hit-or-miss with friendliness.  Some people are cheerful, and some act like they want you to go away.\\\\n\\\\nGood things - I love their coupon rewards.  I guess that's for all CVSes, not just this one, but it keeps me coming back because I get mad style coupons like every other visit.  And I had a good experience getting a walk-in flu shot from the pharmacy from the friendly (and quite attractive) pharmacist.  \\\\n\\\\nI'm just not crazy about the vibe here.  It just seems kind of depressing, with the stuff locked up and the smallish store with kind of a blargh selection.  I would much rather go to other pharmacies, but you can't beat this one for convenience (for me, anyway).  And they have a parking lot, if that helps you.\",\"I came here all the time while I was freelancing and in charge of my own schedule.  It has a lot of points going for it that other thrift shops consistently mess up.\\\\n\\\\n1. It's well lit.  You can SEE the clothing, see whatever might be wrong with it, and make an honest assessment.  You're never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you've just bought.\\\\n\\\\n2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. \\\\n\\\\n3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.\\\\n\\\\n4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.  You never know what you'll find.\\\\n\\\\nA summary of a few things I've bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker's bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....\\\\n\\\\nYou get the picture.  The prices aren't rock bottom, but close enough, and the quality of the clothing will help anyone but the stingiest person get over the 50 cents extra.\\\\n\\\\nCan't recommend it enough!\",\"Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.

Here's why:\\\\n\\\\n1. They sell beer!\\\\n2. Huuuuuge produce selection\\\\n3. Natural/organic foods section: cereal, pasta, soups, etc and fancy chocolate bars\\\\n4. Long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican, indian, italian, asian and , of course, jewish\\\\n5. Functioning bakery with fresh, appetizing breads and desserts (I am still loyal to Allegro Hearth though)\\\\n\\\\nThe store is huge and I haven't been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers, balloons, home/seasonal section, DVD rentals and a photo center as well as a drive-through pharmacy. \\\\n\\\\nIt seems as this GE just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes.\",\"This co-op is probably great for vegans and vegetarians, but I am Paleo.  I was very happy to find grassfed butter, raw milk, and cheese at reasonable prices.  The bulk foods section was missing a few mainstay items I typically pick up, and the meat selection was very poor.  I would like to see a better listing of which meat is grass fed and grass finished, as many of the farms in the frozen meat section did not have any of that information.\\\\n\\\\nFor my future needs, I will be ordering directly from the farm (this co-op sells items from the farm that I will be direct ordering from) at a lower price and will fill in the gaps elsewhere.\",\"My expectations for Whole Foods Market had been established as was growing up in the DMV (D.C., MD, VA) area. Thus, very fresh produce, high-quality meats, diverse cheeses, expansive bulk section, novel food items, exceptional food bars, and excellent customer service were essentially a given. On the other hand, I also expected parking difficulties, even at stores with multi-story garages.\\\\n\\\\nThe Whole Foods Market in Pittsburgh is not much different from those in the DMV area. However, the parking is horrendous! Really, a medium-size private parking lot for the only Whole Foods Market in the Pittsburgh area right along a congested major road? Let me say that Whole Foods Markets in D.C. are also close to major roads, but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers. I would love if the Pittsburgh store can build a garage of some sort (I'm not counting the garage next to the Starbucks and Walgreens) with smooth entry and exit so as to prevent a mini-gridlock along Centre Avenue.\\\\n\\\\nParking situation aside, the Pittsburgh store does live up to my expectations established from the DMV stores. You will rarely find a bad apple (no pun intended), and the store usually keeps shelves stocked (except when there is a major sale or promotion going on). Now, if only its prices and my budget could meet halfway so I could frequent this store more--via bike or my own two feet.\",\"I don't know why, but I just can't like this location very much.  I lived in the area for a little over three years and would always go to another GE before this one.  Maybe it's the way it's set up or maybe it's the way that the lighting seems so very dim.\\\\n\\\\nThe selection is typical for any GE, broad and expansive.  Some prices are a bit steep.  \\\\n\\\\nThis location, like many others, has expanded their pharmacy/health care area.  Which is nice, it saves an extra trip to a drug store.\",\"Yes, the parking lot in crazy. Yes, the prices are outrageously high (it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin'). Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. (Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). \\\\n\\\\nThe produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...\\\\n\\\\nThe HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. \\\\n\\\\nSome of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's \\\\\\\"chicken\\\\\\\" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. \\\\n\\\\nAs a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B! In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. It's next to sushi. It's very good\",\"the parking lot @ this wholefoods is an ABOMINATION!  to compound the issue, whole foods allows their purveyors to park on centre ave (a road that is already miserable enough to drive on) and block traffic. this past monday, a shearer potato chip truck was blocking the right lane. doesn't whole foods have a loading dock? i wrote an email to the district president and he had one of his store minions respond: \\\\\\\"you can park @ walgreens\\\\\\\". sorry, i am shopping @ wholefoods NOT walgreens. translation: whole foods developers were TOO CHEAP to buy the proper amount of real estate. dont even bother coming here fri-sun unless you like a clusterF*** lot full of zombies. this is the 5th WF i have shopped @ (4 in florida) wholefoods should have opened in the south hills. the demographics out there would support it. this wholefoods is BUSH LEAGUE!\",\"I been going to this place since the 90s and this place is the MIDDLE CLASS GE. I stopped going to this place since I got a job at whole foods. My mom went here a two weeks ago for the first tine in a long time she say that the people are still there and the place looks better and the people are a lot friendly now. \\\\nSo if you don't what too shop at a Middle Class food store in East Liberty then go to The Market in Shadyside.\",\"I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience, which is ridiculously horrible at this location - very poorly planned. And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium \\\\\\\"natural\\\\\\\" goods. Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. And I don't even need to talk about customer demographics, because you've all seen Rachel C.'s link!\",\"I agree with other reviews, this store is poorly laid out and honestly makes no sense. Sometimes bigger is not always better. I used to head here often while living near Shadyside to stop at the Family Dollar & hit GE in one run. \\\\n\\\\nI normally only stopped here for a Redbox movie. My debit card got hacked at an outdoor Redbox at a Get Go so I'll only go to a Redbox that is indoor like this one. \\\\n\\\\nAnyways, I'd hit up the liquor store for some wine afterwards for dealing with long lines/wait & awkward clientele outside.\",\"AH!  I am never shopping anywhere else for groceries ever again (except if I want like ketchup and bologna and stuff-- then I'll have to go to giant eagle.)  But, after coming from the middle of nowhere midwest, I cannot tell you how good it feels to see cheese and meat in the grocery store that I actually want to eat.  \\\\n\\\\nAH!\",\"There is nothing like this in chicago!  (that I know of).....I hope I get to stay in Pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage of this co-op.  I love the bulk section, especially since I can choose the quantity of what I want to buy.  Super convenient for travelers.  You can buy pasta, granolla, flour, quinoa, cous cous, cane sugar, spices, YERBA MATE!!!, dried fruit, nuts, olive oil, peanut & almond butter, soap.....man, I could go on & on.  You can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.  \\\\n\\\\nI was suprised that they had cacao powder, for such a small place.  They have a nice little section of tofu, tempeh, & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good.  \\\\n\\\\nThey also have a juice bar & vegetarian \\\\\\\"cafe.\\\\\\\"  I don't think I'd call it a cafe, more like buffet.  I wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked, but I'm not going to penalize them for that.  For such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there.  I really want to try something from their juice bar too!!  \\\\n\\\\nThere must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  Everyone was very curteous and nice.  I should try to make friends with these people since I'm new in town.\",\"This Giant Eagle seems more like a GetGo than an actual supermarket. As soon as you get in you want to get out as quickly as possible.\\\\n\\\\n You don't want to do any major grocery shopping here. For one, the prices are high. Secondly, this Giant Eagle does not carry everything you need. Who has time to run to another store? Just get your basic necessities here.\\\\n\\\\nAs for produce, it can be awful at times. Whenever I go to Giant Eagle Market District down the street, the produce is fresh and smells invigorating.  However, at Shakespeare, you are bound to find produce with wrinkles, open areas, mold and fruit flies- being sold at the same high prices. I can go to Trader Joe's and find much better produce for less.\\\\n\\\\nA pet peeve of mine is the self-checkout lines. Two of them are express lanes for items less than 12; the other lane has a belt if more than 12 items are being purchased. There should be TWO LINES but for some reason customers want to form one long super line, which holds up everything. The staff rarely sorts this out.\\\\nThe customer service is average here and I don't expect it to get any better.\\\\n\\\\nI only go here if I have to grab one or two items. The best times to go are early in the morning or late at night.\",\"This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be.\",\"I have been going to CJ since it opened. I try to go once a week. I have received some good deals there, but in the past couple years, the prices seem to be higher than they should be for used / overstock items. I find myself buying less items than I used to. I think if the prices were more reasonable, they would sell more.\\\\nA new \\\\\\\"reuse\\\\\\\" store has opened in the area nearby. They have more reasonble prices and thier building is heated.\",\"Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection.\",\"I loved Whole Foods in Ohio.  It was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce.\\\\n\\\\nHere?  Well, first of all, the parking lot is a death-trap full of upscale SUVs who have no idea how to drive courteously.  (A few pointers: use your turn signals, wait your turn, drive slowly in a parking lot, and put your cart back!)  My blood pressure skyrockets the second I even try to pull in here.\\\\n\\\\nSecondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark.  I don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's depressing.\\\\n\\\\nThirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice.  \\\\n\\\\nThere are a few good points, though.  The sushi (at least the vegetarian varieties) are good, and the desserts are delicious and beautiful.  The salad bar and prepared foods always look good, and the staff is friendly.  But I still try to avoid Whole Foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot.\",\"Compared to other Whole Foods locations, this one is tiny! For comparison, the Whole Foods in Las Vegas must be at least three times the size. Still, it's nice to have and it is pretty decent overall albeit pricey.\",\"This place has steadily improved over the years, and never fails to make me happy.  \\\\n\\\\nIt's stocked with every variety of weird hippie food.  It's also stocked with the best produce anywhere in the city in the winter months when Giant Eagle's selection looks beat up.  The prepared foods case in the back is deliciously weird.  And it's locally owned/operated, so you're not exactly sending your hard earned money to Whole Food's CEO.\\\\n\\\\nThe membership is lifetime, apparently, which the employees always kind of failed to express; I thought you had to pay for it yearly, and the difference is pretty big.   That said, I live far enough away that getting here regularly still doesn't justify the membership.\",\"I love Whole Foods, and I have been a fan for a few years now. I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.\\\\n\\\\nStaff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. \\\\n\\\\nThe cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. \\\\n\\\\nDeli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! \\\\n\\\\nThe tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. \\\\n\\\\nCheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. \\\\n\\\\nStore Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. \\\\n\\\\nWhole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. \\\\n\\\\nP.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here!\",\"As a vegan (since 2008) we are a regular at whole foods. It's convenient since we live in Lawrenceville. My one and biggest complaint is that they need to carry more (if not all) organic produce. Not this \\\\\\\"conventional\\\\\\\" garbage. Other than that they have a huge variety of products and grocery items to choose from. Staff is always friendly and helpful.\",\"Big Bang Bicycles is phenomenal! Amazing selection and service! I live in the San Francisco, Bay Area with plenty of premium bicycle shops available, but I do most of my cycling shopping at Big Bang Bicycles when I visit family in Pittsburgh. This shop carries top gear and has in stock tons of options so you can see, feel and evaluate them first hand to know what's going to give you the best feel and performance. Glenn, the owner, is very knowledgeable, friendly and you can feel his passion for cycling and making sure you get the right product and fit for you.  Even if you're not in the Pittsburgh area but you know what you want -- send your order to Big Bang Bicycles and I'm certain you'll have a great experience. Awesome shop! Thank you Glenn and team!\",\"I'll be honest, I just don't get it.  When it comes to eating I do not adhere to any particular mantra or dietary restriction like vegan, organic, vegetarian, ethical, etc.  If it's edible and it's within my palate's liking range then I eat it.\\\\n\\\\nFrom that perspective this place just gets two stars.  Some items were higher priced but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I guess justify it if you had to have it.  But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced.  So it feels like 90% of their inventory is priced at a whole-store experience premium.\\\\n\\\\nTheir prepared meals section was marvelous, and their cut fruit section was like I had died and gone to heaven.  But that's about the only two sections I probably would have been willing to open up my wallet.\",\"Forget Whole Foods when you have East End Cooperative! Honestly, this is quite possibly one of my favorite coops. They make some amazing deli items...so amazing that I went back twice during my visit to PA. I was only expecting to have a few options in the prepared food section, but the vegan options were plentiful. Their mock tuna salad was impressive, made with tvp, vegenaise, and spices. The potato salad was creamy and exceptionally delicious. And the vegan pasta salad was also impressive. Generally most grocers fail in this department, but East End excels by leaps and bounds. I can't believe how tasty their store-made food was. The prices were also very reasonable, if not low. If I lived in PA, I'd join their coop and would go there frequently.\",\"I think the only thing I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers.  Let's see why.....\\\\n\\\\nI attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  \\\\n\\\\nSo I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).  So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds.  But then I decide to buy \\\\\\\"fresh\\\\\\\" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try.  (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it.  Gimmie my Jif.)  So while I am waiting in line, I see the  bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere.  \\\\n\\\\nRegardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my \\\\\\\"whole food\\\\\\\".  And at least I put my cart back.\",\"I just found this place a month back and I'm kind of blown away by how awesome it is. Fresh produce, awesome prepared salads and dips, bulk everything, natural cleaners, and plenty of hippie garbage you can't help but fill your shelves with. The best part is that they try to stock up with locally sourced produce, milk, and meat. And you can get a good discount if you purchase stock in the co-op.\",\"This is a good co-op, with a generous selection for it's smallish size. Prices are better here than in some co-ops I've shopped at. Competitive with the big boxes, as far as I can tell. I have tried some hot-bar/cafe items and quite liked them. The java jolt smoothie is amazing, as is the lemon pepper tofu sandwich!\\\\n\\\\nIf you can judge a town by its co-op, which I am prone to do, Pittsburgh proves to be a decent place to be a conscientious vegetarian shopper.\",\"TimeBomb is without a doubt the best spot in Pittsburgh to get all the exclusive Raw street merchandise. This is my favorite store in the city not only because of it's selection of merchandise, but for it's uniqueness. \\\\n\\\\nThe owner Brick who started the store in '95 I believe is a great guy who always takes care of his loyal customers. I've received free apparel, stickers, DVDs, mixtapes, you name it from Brick. He's a man who knows how to keep his customers coming back! \\\\n\\\\nAll in all TimeBomb is the place to shop in Pittsburgh if you're looking to \\\\\\\"Get Your Life Right\\\\\\\"\",\"Great selection of vegan, vegetarian, raw milk, prepared foods, bakery, cheeses and aged beef. Very expensive, trader Joe's and Market district come to mind as a cheaper alternative. Parking at this particular store is a nightmare.\",\"This place has amazing selection when it comes to some things and zero selection when it comes to others.  We popped in here a couple times over the weekend I spent in PIT and both times they didn't really have what we were looking for.  Visit #1: Liquid smoke.  Visit #2: Hawaiian rolls.  I know these items must exist in PA just not @G-Eagle.  \\\\n\\\\nThey did however have crazy selection when it came to things like....corned beef brisket or anything that has potato in it.  My californian mind was boggled by the variety of brands and cuts of corned beef that were available.  Too bad that wasn't what I was there for.\",\"Lots of great vegan, local, organic, gluten-free, and/or raw food, though some items are quite pricey. Very good rotating-item hot bar for take-out lunch or dinner. Great bulk food selection, including diverse reusable glassware of known tare weight. Fresh fruits and vegetables are right-priced, but processed items like meats, cheeses, and frozen items can be surprisingly expensive. Fairly comprehensive selection, akin to a Whole Foods.\",\"I like this Whole Foods location. I will tell you why.\\\\n\\\\nMany Yelpers have docked stars for the parking lot. I think that's irrelevant. The parking lot, which is actually shared by Starbucks, Wine & Spirits, Walgreens, PNC, and more is two levels and is enormous! Walk a little. You can even take your cart up the elevator.\\\\n\\\\nThe Pittsburgh location is not a superstore. Other Whole Foods have a restaurant, brick oven pizzas, smoothie bar, coffee bar, many more food bars, wine, beer, and so forth. This is a teeny weeny Whole Foods. For its size, the selection is pretty impressive. For example, my mom saw something on Dr. Oz called Lingonberry Jam and asked if I would look for it, and there it was. Never heard of it before, but they had it. \\\\n\\\\nWhole Foods has that \\\\\\\"whole paycheck\\\\\\\" reputation. Granted, this is true if you're spending your whole paycheck on rare, gourmet, specialty foods! If that's the case, you might want to rein in your spending a little. \\\\n\\\\nI actually took a notebook to Trader Joe's, Giant Eagle, and Whole Foods when I first moved to Pittsburgh to compare prices. Giant Eagle (Greenfield location) was the most expensive by an overwhelming margin! Trader Joe's was the best value overall, but Whole Foods was very close, and sometimes a little better quality might be worth it. Their 365 brand is especially reasonable for your regular grocery staples.\\\\n\\\\nAs for the occasional splurge, this is a good place to try something different. I admit it's hard not to get something extra, but I know I can only blame that final total on myself!\",\"There is nothing better than a neighborhood market, and Frick Park Market fits the bill. Come here for grocery staples, a great homemade sandwich (get the breakfast sandwich, any of them!), or just to hang out. The owner will be there & is happy to talk to you.\\\\n\\\\nThe best part about the market, though, is when the kids get off school & come into the store for candy & soda. You can tell that the business is connected to the neighborhood and that everyone gets along. Pittsburgh treasure!\",\"Parking is tough, the food selection is great, and if you call ahead they will set aside awesome moving boxes for you.\",\"I don't know, maybe I'm not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...\\\\n\\\\nI have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.\\\\n\\\\nThier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is Pennsylvania.  You can't buy those things at the grocery store.  \\\\n\\\\nI can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes, even better quality.\\\\n\\\\nI guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  I'm not slamming Whole Foods at all, but I actually like Trader Joe's better.\",\"Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. There was honking, some road rage and confusion. But I will say that I should have known better coming into a grocery store before a major partying holiday.  \\\\n\\\\nAnyway, in terms of produce this place is awesome. I got my meat and bacon from this joint and have not been disappointed. I also love their premade hamburgers. They are delish. This is also a great place to find a great assortment of cheeses and grass fed butter ( I go for the kerry gold products, they are just awesome).  \\\\n\\\\nAlso if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container.  This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap. Overall, whole foods is not cheap, but if you want quality this is the place to go. Just dont go here on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve... you'll end up ripping your hair out!!\",\"I love everything that Whole Foods offers, but I can't stand the experience of going there. The parking lot is a mess of aggressive drivers acting like the extra 50 feet of walking will negatively affect the environment more than their driving around the parking lot until a better space opens up. Once you get a space and finally get inside, the experience mirrors that of the parking lot. Everyone is in each others' way and trying to be the first one to find the best organic orange or grab the last package vegan general tso's in the store.\\\\n\\\\nTo be fair, though, the experience is still 100 times better than going to the Market District a few blocks down the same street. Similar in-store and in-lot experience, but with a better and higher-quality selection. The staff is always really nice and super helpful, and their trays of fruit and veggies are excellent. We've ordered them countless times for parties and have never been let down. Pricey, but excellent quality. The prepared foods are delicious, and their prepackaged prepared foods are also really good...but like nearly everything else in Whole Foods, a little pricey. For example, their yummy tomato bisque is $7. Hardly cheap enough for a quick lunch, but it is yummy. Their baked goods are delicious as well. We're constantly picking up bread from there (and the occasional doughnut), and we're never disappointed.\\\\n\\\\nTheir meats and seafoods departments are also excellent. They have a great variety and are always helpful in answering any questions that I've had (although we still opt for our meats from DJ's). Of course, if you're at Whole Foods your'e likely there for the organic options, and as to be expected, you're not going to find a better selection anywhere else. More unique, perhaps, but their inventory just won't be matched any time soon for those foods. Surprisingly, third-party & prepackaged pricing is actually on-par with Giant Eagle, so whenever we're looking for those types of items (milk/eggs/pastas, etc.), we always opt for Whole Foods.\",\"So..... when I think about shopping at Whole Foods, I always create an alternate universe where I think I would be able to shop here. I think: if I made at least twice the amount of money I currently do, I would be able to be a member of the club and shop here. .... but I don't. Thus, I only stop in here on very special occasions when I 1. can withstand the rage I feel when I pull into this parking lot; and 2. I want to either eat at the buffet or buy a very specific item. I would definitely recommend that others stop in sometime to get some food at the buffet. The quality of everything is pretty incredible (though of course it's typically really expensive).\",\"Another store which has gone the way of the Dodo bird. Actually there was nothing basement like about it. What will be done with the empty space that is the question?\",\"I prefer this store to the Market District on Centre. It's just as overpriced and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy, but carries less products to sift through when you just need to grab some simple things, hopefully not produce. Parking is easy and you can hit up the unpretentious Wine and Spirits in the same stop. I think this plaza still exists to prevent impoverished people from venturing into the other newer fancier stores which are a mere half mile away and designed to appeal to people who think they are cultured and discerning.\",\"I cannot in my life understand why this Giant Eagle, of all the Giant Eagles, would get a five star rating.  From the moment you walk into here it's like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time you're in there.\\\\n\\\\nThe set up is ridiculous.  I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.  Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had.  It's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever.  \\\\n\\\\nHonestly, I only went here because I was at Target and didn't want to venture any further to complete my shopping.\",\"oddly enough, of all the giant eagles i have visited in pittsburgh, this is the only location that carries the toothpaste that i've used for most of my life (outside of pittsburgh). the location is clean and the staff are friendly.  i sometimes resent having a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment, as many of the items that i buy there are severely overpriced. but whenever i run out of groceries and toothpaste at the same time, i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here, although they may not carry all the groceries that i'd like.\",\"Everybody, chill out.  This is a trendy place to shop, yes, but it also has better prices on some things than Giant Eagle or Trader Joe's (Gasp!).  I split my time between Here, Giant Eagle and Trader Joe's pretty evenly, depending on what specialty items I might need.\\\\n\\\\nOh yeah, don't drive here.  Walk, ride your bike or take the bus.  If you're really smart, you'll avoid the headache and park on one of the many adjacent side streets.\",\"I stopped by here on my way home from whole foods market. They had just paved there parking lot which can only fit 3 max cars at a time. It was not as big as the one I normally shop at in Penn Hills. They are a beer distributor and have a way hugger selection. But they serve all of penn hills so go figure.\\\\n\\\\nI was looking for a gluten free beer which they had four kinds including cider. The prices were crazy expensive. $35 for a 24 pack of cider. NO way!! \\\\n\\\\nI had to buy it though cause it was sunday at 4:30 and all the stores close at 5 so i had no choice. I should have waited but i drove all the way here to get it so I should just buy it while i'm there. Aside from the money issue this place was just ok to me.\",\"everything is a cluster.  the store.  the parking lot.  the people -- customers included.  full-on cluster. barely any parking for a massive, heavily polluting pick up truck.\\\\n\\\\ninside: avocados are the price of gold, and there are no goddamn vegan taco spices at a place that's supposed to be so fancy.  \\\\n\\\\nmeh.  go to market district where they keep it real.  real classy!!!\",\"This store is great - it's got all of the fresh specialty items we need for cooking great weekend meals for friends, but isn't a vast, overpowering warehouse. Items are well organized, and easy to find. As others' state, it ain't cheap! \\\\n\\\\nOne way we lowered our Whole Foods bill was to go for their 365 in-house brand, which is typically priced at the same pricepoint as similar items in the regular chain grocery stores. We don't use Whole Foods for all of our supermarket needs, just the specialty items, great produce, and seafood.\\\\n\\\\nI docked two stars for absolutely terrible parking - yep. I know that's harsh, but every time we come here, we need to factor in another 10-15 minutes to get a parking spot and be able to leave safely (there are always cars behind us looking for a spot when we are trying to leave, and so we often can't just pull out of the space and leave quickly...) Even being careful, we have almost been hit multiple times by people losing their cool with the terrible parking.\\\\n\\\\nThat being said, we will continue to come here to stock our home when we plan to entertain at home.\",\"Kind of small, but I've had excellent luck with produce here: fresh and organic. In-store coffee bar is a nice plus.\",\"As a displaced west-coaster, I appreciate a store like this in Pittsburgh. \\\\n\\\\nI like the bulk goods and spices because you can take as much as you need, you get the spices whole and they put them in big jars so you can sniff them if you want before you buy (the downside to that is that every time the jars get opened the spices probably lose some oils), and there's a huge selection. \\\\n\\\\nThis place has my quinoa, pearled barley, spelt flour, and nutritional yeast. \\\\n\\\\nSome of the vegetables pop out at me and I'm tempted to buy a lemon or some really ripe piece of fruit. Usually I don't though. During the summer they were selling fresh herbs in pots. That was really tempting. Once they sold kittens. That was amazing. \\\\n\\\\nIt doesn't hurt that its right by the climbing wall, fencing, gymnastics, and bike shop.\",\"I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has.  Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\\\\n\\\\n1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.\\\\n\\\\n2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   \\\\n\\\\n3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\\\\n\\\\n4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\\\\n\\\\n5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\\\\n\\\\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed \\\\\\\"the dirty bird.\\\\\\\"  Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.\",\"This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market, and was pleasantly surprised with the selection. I got Beemster Vlaskas, an amazing Gouda. Very large parking lot.\",\"Oh Whole Foods, you are so so very overpriced.  I so so wish you were not, because I love the idea of the place.  But I just cannot bring myself to do my normal grocery shopping here.  I can't bring myself to spend the big bucks!\\\\n\\\\nThe place is always packed and you're usually left bumping into people left and right.  You may even get a nasty look, yikes!  The parking is atrocious, with only probably only 75 spots for a pretty popular store.  And have fun just getting into the parking lot from Centre.  Okay, I'm going to a negative place right now....\\\\n\\\\nI stop in here one a whim when I'm out in the area if I'm really craving sushi, because it's way better than the Giant Eagle's sushi down the street.  It's still not he best fast sushi (Giant Eagle Waterfront), but it does the job.  Again, they're almost $3 more than at GE.  When I run in to grab sushi and usually ad Odwalla by bill comes to almost $20!  I'd rather eat a fast meal at Qdoba...sorry...I said it!\\\\n\\\\nMy feelings can best be summed up with this....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UFc1pr2yUU\",\"This store is pretty good. Yes it is fairly expensive but you can get quite a few items that are difficult if not impossible to find at other stores. They have a nice meat department with quite a few good naturally raised products, particularly beef. We've been very happy with their produce, which we find noticeably better than Trader Joe.\\\\n\\\\nI wish it was bigger so there was a larger selection and a larger prepared food selection (we are used to the larger stores in Chicago). Also wish there was a liquor department but I'll probably have to run for state office for that. Frankly the worst part is often parking. Don't know what causes everyone to behave badly in their lot (myself included) but man it can be a mess. \\\\n\\\\nAnyway we'll keep going at least for meats and produce.\",\"It's not the greatest Target of all time but it still meets all of your basic needs.\\\\n\\\\nIf you're looking for produce, lower prices, and bigger selection in every department then head to the Target in East Liberty.\",\"Worst parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged, self-important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation (allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one). Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try $5, for real. If you want to sum up Whole Foods, just remember it's a place where you can literally spend $5 on an apple. Also, the CEO John Mackey voted for MItt Romney (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/john-mackey-the-kale-king.html?_r=0), so if you think you're shopping in a mecca of neo-progressive, pre-utopian bliss, think again.  Waste of time AND money overall.\",\"local, friendly businesses serving a great product DO still exist.\",\"Whole paycheck is a fitting name.\\\\n\\\\nThis Whole Foods is decent for regular items but their prepared food prices have gotten really high as of late.  \\\\n\\\\nI used to shop here for almost everything but their common products can now be had at almost any other grocery store for less.\\\\n\\\\nWhole Foods had it's day as a unique place to shop with hard to find organic produce and products. \\\\n\\\\nNow it's just more expensive.\",\"Nice Giant Eagle, not as nice as their new Market Districts, but you can look at this Giant Eagle and see how they came up with the Market District Idea and rolled with it. Fresh made sushi, good cheese selection, awesome bakery.\",\"I am a big fan of the Whole Foods company in general.  The store back home (Omaha) had a wine bar, espresso bar, gelato, sushi and udon stand, a GIANT cheese counter where you could sample...I could go on.\\\\n\\\\nThe Pittsburgh Whole Foods is small, and almost as overcrowded as its parking lot.  Two-thirds of the time they are out of what I came for.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying THAT much for groceries, I want a stellar shopping experience.  This WF is mediocre at best.\",\"It's disappointing that you got lukewarm service, Erina.  I've had pretty consistently good vibes (har har--get it?--hippie reference) there from the staff, who've been enthusiastic about helping me find what I need.  Hands down, this place beats Whole Foods for price and general atmosphere, and their salad and hot bar is my go-to when I don't feel like cooking.  Absolutely GREAT bulk section with a wide variety of grains, legumes, and pastas.  Killer cookies and baked goods.  \\\\nOn the other hand--if I lived on my own, I could do all my shopping here.  But, since I don't--I can't.  It's tough to stock a household kitchen solely from the EEFC--I mean, I can't really afford to regularly buy $15 laundry detergent.  \\\\nRealistically, the Co-op can't serve most of us for one-stop shopping.

The place was crowded, as usual, but the line went fairly quickly. On my way in, I saw a $5 fish sandwich with creamy coleslaw advertised outside. Three guys were there cooking. Looked and smelled delicious, so I paid inside with my groceries. When I came out, I told the guys I bought one. They were really nice and asked me what kind of bread I wanted and what I wanted on the sandwich.\\\\n\\\\nSome lady that was \\\\\\\"in a rush\\\\\\\" was upset her sandwich wasn't ready when she came out (but they explained the fish was cooked, but they couldn't set up the sandwich without knowing what bread or toppings she wanted). Just watching the way they dealt with this customer was great for me. The guys were so friendly and patient.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, the sandwich was delicious! The coleslaw was also awesome! Yay! I am so happy I stopped by when I did.\",\"I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.\\\\n\\\\nAfter my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to \\\\\\\"apologize\\\\\\\". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would \\\\\\\"never salt his steak again\\\\\\\". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. \\\\n\\\\nThe drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have.\",\"This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked \\\\\\\"doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture?\\\\\\\" she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn't even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers.\",\"Despite my 3-star rating, I think I will be coming back here again to give it a second try.\\\\n\\\\nI got the smashed potatoes with seitan, cheese, and aioli.  The first bite was OK--the aioli didn't quite suit my taste, but everything else worked pretty well together.  However, 20 some-odd bites in to the dish, the flavors were getting repetitive and the mushy texture started to gross me out.  I got about half-way through eating the dish and the so-so aioli became too much for me.  I couldn't take another bite.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, my wife's apple panini was delicious.  I would probably eat a few of those if I came back.  The cream cheese, cinnamon (from the bread?), and apple all worked together in glorious harmony.\\\\n\\\\nOn a strange note, while we were eating, some camera guys came in and started setting up what looked to be an interview.  We asked the staff what was going on.  Apparently someone was filming their submission/application to be on a reality show.  \\\\\\\"Oh cool,\\\\\\\" we thought.  \\\\\\\"What reality show?\\\\\\\" we asked.  \\\\\\\"Not sure, something on the Golf Channel,\\\\\\\" they replied.  HAHAHAHA!  I thought watching grass growing on TV was boring enough.  Now they're making a reality show about it.\\\\n\\\\nIn the end,  the gross aioli was inexcusable to me.  Otherwise, I'd probably go 4 stars.   I still plan to come back and give it another shot.\",\"I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\\\\n\\\\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\\\\n\\\\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\\\\n\\\\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\\\\n\\\\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\\\\n\\\\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \\\\n\\\\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\\\\n\\\\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \\\\n\\\\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \\\\\\\"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\\\\\\\" Well, that didn't happen.\\\\n\\\\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \\\\n\\\\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\\\\n\\\\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\\\\n\\\\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.\",\"This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving the service one. We didn't eat anything so I can't comment on the food. \\\\n\\\\nMy husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.\\\\n\\\\nThe bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.\\\\n\\\\nTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. I used to work as a server so I could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. I will NEVER go back.\",\"I've been to Buffalo Blues a few times at Happy Hour, and met my daughter there last night for Happy Hour specials as advertised on the web site.  First clue:  no Happy Hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the Yeungs and Wings (which was not what we were looking for).  We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture.  Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.  I think we're done here.\",\"I was SO ready to like this place!  Turns out, not so much.  It was okay.  No better than TGIFridays, but better than Eat n Park!  The deets.\\\\n\\\\nThe hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \\\\\\\"just to be sure.\\\\\\\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.\\\\n\\\\nHub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \\\\\\\"fine.\\\\\\\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!\\\\n\\\\nThe tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.  We'll hit the Improv again - we have before - but, we'll head somewhere else afterwards.\",\"Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\\\\n\\\\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\\\\n\\\\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\\\\n\\\\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\\\\n\\\\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\\\\n\\\\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\\\\n\\\\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \\\\n\\\\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \\\\n\\\\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\\\\n\\\\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\\\\n\\\\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\\\\n\\\\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\\\\n\\\\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\\\\n\\\\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.\",\"I came into Quiet Storm not intending to have lunch, but just a latte and hang out to answer some emails for a little while (working from home makes me stir crazy, so bouncing around local coffeehouses, completely NOT fitting in with the crowd kinda makes my day sometimes). \\\\n\\\\nI walked up to the bar and was just going to grab a seat there, but super hipster server guy asked me to take a table, because it had an outlet to plug my laptop in. I didn't need to, but  ... good lookin' out. \\\\n\\\\nAnyway, ordered my latte - good espresso, but pretty weak foam. Served in a pint glass. That's fine. \\\\n\\\\nMenu actually looked really good, so I went for a sammy with apples, seitan sausage crumbles, and cheese. They offer different sides, but my super hipster server guy didn't ask me what I wanted; so being a newbie I figured maybe that was only with certain menu items. I was wrong, when the guy taking care of the table behind me was asked what he wanted. My fault for not speaking up. Sandwich was good, not to die for though, and frankly kinda small for $8. \\\\n\\\\nI'll finish with this: Internets are free, right? So, where's the code? Did I need to ask??\\\\nI'll definitely go back though, intrigued by a few other things on the menu (like bbq tenders and pulled 'pork' quesadilla), and hopefully be a little more impressed.\",\"The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.\\\\n\\\\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    \\\\n\\\\nSecond, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. \\\\n\\\\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    \\\\n\\\\nOverall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.\",\"just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction.  normally, i have had the best experiences there. . . all have been very cooperative and helpful.  but, i guess they are so successful that they are becoming arrogant.  here's the rub:  my hubby sent me a picture of a chandelier they had; i did not see the picture until 30 minutes later; by then he had left the store.  i called to BUY the chandelier over the phone.  this has been done before (we WERE construction junction junkies).  the lady adamantly refused to help me. she adamantly refuesed to even listen to a description of the fixture!  she gave the following excuses:\\\\\\\" well, if you have been here in the last 12 years, you know how this place works\\\\\\\";  \\\\\\\"I can't go back there and try to find out what you want\\\\\\\"; \\\\\\\"i am the only one on the floor\\\\\\\"; \\\\\\\"this is first come, first serve\\\\\\\"; \\\\\\\"if your husband comes in and it is still here, then we'll sell it to him\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"how will i know which one it is - we have so many back there...\\\\\\\" .... i could hear the smirk in her voice as she enjoyed blowing me off. . .  i even offered to send her the picture my husband sent me via email - she refused.  keep in mind, i wanted to pay for the item.  my husband cannot go back to construction junction today. . . most likely the item will be gone. . . it would have been nice had this  sales agent been more helpful - especially when it was clear how badly i wanted to buy the fixture.  she did not express any concern whatsoever for my requests:  (like, so sorry, i can't help you at the moment, please call back and i'll try to accomodate; give me a brief description and i'll try to find it... etc.).  sometimes, even if you can't accomodate someone, it's how you say it that makes all the difference.  construction junction will implode if it begins to treat its customers indifferently.\",\"I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out.\",\"I always see this place, and Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he loved. I however, ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. The pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. It was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning.\",\"Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.\\\\n\\\\nOur waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.\\\\n\\\\nHere's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\\\\n \\\\nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\\\\n\\\\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.\",\"Prepare to be wowed. \\\\n\\\\nHigh class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. \\\\\\\"Gar\\\\u00e7on\\\\\\\" I asked, \\\\\\\"may I try some of your french fried potatoes?\\\\\\\" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence.\",\"I agree with Paul on this one. But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. \\\\n(I think I feel my heart yelling at me again) , The gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet , I just might go back and ask her to marry me! \\\\nBut then again , she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online. \\\\nMaybe she just wanted my positive response. Ok Sarah B. you got it ... now where's my free coke ?\",\"Well, it started well. Food was okay. Deep dish pizza was good. But the salad we had - too tiny portion!!!\\\\nWe were greeted and seated well. But later the service was not all good. Bad bad service. First of all we had to ask for everything we wanted. The server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. She just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more).\\\\nLater when we talked about this in the front, the girl there also just listened and said \\\\\\\"okay\\\\\\\", not even a sorry once!!!\\\\nI would not like to go there again... :(\",\"ewwww\",\"We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \\\\\\\"yep\\\\\\\" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \\\\\\\"What do you want me to do\\\\\\\"?\\\\n\\\\nMy friend said \\\\\\\"An apology would be a good start\\\\\\\" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \\\\\\\"Get out and don't come back\\\\\\\" ???????? Are you kidding????\\\\n\\\\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \\\\n\\\\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\\\\n\\\\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service.\",\"I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\\\\n\\\\n20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \\\\\\\"definitely\\\\\\\" put our order in so it \\\\\\\"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\\\\\\\" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?\\\\n\\\\nThe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.\",\"Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\\\\n\\\\n1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\\\\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\\\\n3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \\\\\\\"Oh... I don't know\\\\\\\" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \\\\\\\"Let me check that for you\\\\\\\") he instead said \\\\\\\"Well, I'm going to hang up now.\\\\\\\"  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\\\\n4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\\\\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\\\\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\\\\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \\\\\\\"I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\\\\\\\" to which she responded \\\\\\\"Yeah that should be fine\\\\\\\" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\\\\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\\\\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \\\\\\\"Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\\\\\\\" \\\\n10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\\\\n\\\\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \\\\\\\"Effing Men's Wearhouse.\\\\\\\"  For example, at a restaurant, \\\\\\\"Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAnother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \\\\\\\"I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding\\\\\\\" to which I replied \\\\\\\"Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nCongrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.\\\\n\\\\nTL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.\",\"You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know. \\\\n\\\\nI used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \\\\n\\\\nAfter having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....\\\\\\\"You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\\\\\\\". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \\\\\\\"bathroom break\\\\\\\", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach.\",\"This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian  spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again. \\\\n\\\\nI don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said \\\\\\\"dish looks beautiful.\\\\\\\" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  \\\\n\\\\nThe table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says \\\\\\\"I really enjoyed the steak you sent back.\\\\\\\" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!\\\\nAt this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said \\\\\\\"it's not my job to make people happy\\\\\\\" that's strange considering he wants our business. \\\\nSo the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.\\\\n\\\\nI couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.  Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  Sorry, we will never step foot in here again.\",\"Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. \\\\n\\\\nJust when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. \\\\n\\\\nSo if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!\",\"I ate here at around 8:00 on a Saturday night.  Reading the other reviews, it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant I was.  Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.\\\\n\\\\nWe were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  \\\\n\\\\nMy fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a \\\\\\\"baked potato pizza\\\\\\\" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.\",\"Very disappointing meal.  After waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.\\\\n\\\\n  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? \\\\n\\\\nTo make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.\\\\n\\\\nLong story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place!\",\"Well this visit started off good. I was seated right away, no wait. Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers. Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. \\\\n\\\\nNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are. Was just horrible.\",\"Had dinner at Papa J's with a group of 6.  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.\\\\n\\\\nPeople ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.\\\\n\\\\nHard to tell if the deserts were \\\\\\\"homemade.\\\\\\\"  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. \\\\n\\\\nOn the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J's.  \\\\\\\"A-ok\\\\\\\" probably is the best way to describe it.\",\"A group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive. We where the only normal people in this place. The kids next to us who where only 14 where bragging and saying that they went to jail 2 times in their life. You had people selling their food outsdie the resturant. after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked. While we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it. Must I say more? bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for you.\",\"If you look at other reviews you will see that I am a very positive person, but tonight was an utter disaster!!  We sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable. We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did.  She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. We ordered appetizers and they never came out.  She actually brought us our check and we never got our food. By the way we were the only people at the bar.  Finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. We finally got seated by the windows. Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. Nothing was comped and no manager was available. This PF Changs needs new management!! We will never return. I will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. Steer clear until changes are made. It's not worth the headache.\",\"Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.\\\\n\\\\nWe walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\\\\n\\\\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\\\\n\\\\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \\\\n\\\\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\\\\n\\\\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom...\",\"Fast food done right, what more can you want?\\\\n\\\\nA throwback to old timey diners, steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price. \\\\n\\\\nMy sisters and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour, which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise. This meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off! \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the western BBQ burger, which was 2 thin patties, cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, and fried onions. It came with shoe string fries (my favorite), all for the low price of $4.79. Are you kidding me? What's not to like! The food was actually pretty good! I liked it a lot. Since it was happy hour I also \\\\\\\"splurged\\\\\\\" on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. It was meh. Could have gone without it. The overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off, but the hot fudge saved it. But, how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, 3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20. A steal. Also the food is good! I enjoyed it. I'd come back.\",\"I really enjoyed my Mongolian beef and pork pot stickers, but \\\\nThere was NO presentation of pfc mixing sauces. \\\\nOne of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill Non franchise is PRESENTATION and experience.  I was extremely disappointed by the LACK of presentation. \\\\n\\\\nReservations:\\\\nOur party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.\\\\n\\\\nAt 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . Obviously someone dropped the ball here.....\\\\n\\\\nWhen we requested silverware for the table. Our waitress blamed it on the hostess. Yes, theHostess should have provided silverware.. However It was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. As a Patron I could care less who's fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. Defiantly took away from my pfc experience.\\\\n\\\\nMy Hot and sour soup is usally served with\\\\\\\"noodley\\\\\\\" things that I drop in the soup. We weren't given any \\\\\\\"noodley \\\\\\\" things . Not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn't selling food as much as they are selling an experience. This experience is what sets this restaurant apart.\",\"While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. \\\\n\\\\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.\\\\n\\\\nin my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. \\\\n\\\\nI'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. \\\\n\\\\nFor me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!\",\"Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\\\\n\\\\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \\\\n\\\\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \\\\\\\"Are you working?\\\\\\\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\\\\n\\\\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \\\\n\\\\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \\\\n\\\\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \\\\n\\\\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.\",\"Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order.\",\"If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \\\\\\\"pies\\\\\\\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \\\\\\\"they were out\\\\\\\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.\",\"If you don't like your food... do not send it back to the kitchen... The \\\\\\\"Chef\\\\\\\" will come out and scream at you... Stay away from this place.\",\"We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. \\\\n\\\\nOne of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! \\\\n\\\\nSpoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \\\\\\\"Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\\\\\\\" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!\\\\n\\\\nNot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. \\\\n\\\\nI am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!\",\"We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. My date was given vodka on the rocks. and I was given a Sam Adams.. \\\\nThey took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. We told them to bring another round and the check.  It was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.\\\\n\\\\nBy this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and I gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.\\\\n\\\\nfor 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka I was charged $31.03. I didn't have time to complain or ask. I won't be going back.\",\"My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. It was easy to find and no problems with parking. It's \\\\\\\"Seat Yourself\\\\\\\", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I'm guessing that this was Barb. She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. No big deal and her apology was appreciated. She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love, but come on now. We ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. The food was alright, really nothing special. A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. We may or may not go back.\",\"I've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  I also should have known that I shouldn't have cheated on my diet.\\\\n\\\\nI figured I'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  I opted for the Popcorn Chicken Salad.  Sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  Iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.  \\\\n\\\\nI have to say that even though I was saying yes, my body was saying, 'OH hell no!'\\\\n\\\\nI'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort.  Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now.  Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.\\\\n\\\\nI'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.\",\"The Pros: Great view of the city and river in good weather...  \\\\nLovely for loud large groups\\\\nVaried menu with some original items\\\\nGreat place to watch a game inside with a huge bar\\\\nFun location\\\\nGood place to take out of towners.\\\\n\\\\nThe Cons: The food when I went yesterday was not great.  We got the wrong sandwich, our order wasn't as described because the kitchen was out of \\\\\\\"lots of things\\\\\\\"  (Tell us when we order, not when you deliver the meal without elements on the plate.)  \\\\nCan be loud--not a place for a romantic date...\\\\nThe bathroom condition was really bad.\\\\n\\\\nThe server did comp up an appetizer, and they were friendly enough.. they just failed to wow. \\\\n\\\\nThe view was great, and we did enjoy walking around seeing the fountain dance to \\\\\\\"Pour some sugar on me\\\\\\\"  seriously?!?!?  Yes!   Classy eh?\",\"Meh, I've experienced better is an understatement.\\\\n\\\\nFriday's is like the \\\\\\\"fine dining chain\\\\\\\" for every yinzer in Pittsburgh...\\\\n\\\\n1.  When we were seated, it was quick which was a surprise.  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why.  I was happy about that.\\\\n2.  I ordered one of their \\\\\\\"skinny margaritas\\\\\\\", blackberry to be exact.  It was a nice size, however, at $6.00/pop, that was half of my food bill.\\\\n3.  The waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone.  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha!\\\\n4.  Food came.  My burger had lettuce on it only.  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  I had to wait to ask for my pickle.\\\\n5.  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting.  Disappointment.\\\\n6.  The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  \\\\n\\\\nNever again will I eat at Friday's.  I will, however, go should a happy hour arise...\",\"My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.\\\\n\\\\nThe food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\\\\n\\\\nThe service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\\\\n\\\\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\\\\n\\\\nThe prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\\\\n\\\\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's.\",\"They burned my fish and they burned it bad.  Ordering fish at Eat'n Park is always a gamble.  I just never know how it's going to turn out.  I'm a risk taker so I ordered two pieces of baked lemon sole. \\\\n\\\\nWell it went terribly wrong.  My waiter came out and said, \\\\\\\"They burned your fish, so I had them put two new pieces in the oven.\\\\\\\"  I was impressed by his honesty and didn't mind waiting for two new pieces.  \\\\n\\\\n I gladly helped myself to my boyfriend's french toast while I waited. \\\\n\\\\nThen out of no where another server comes to the table with the burnt fish and sets it down infront of me. With the burnt side down of course.  That just shows the kitchen is not in total coordination.  \\\\n\\\\nLike I said getting fish from Eatn' Park is a toss up. In the end I got two nicely baked pieces of sole to replace the burnt ones, so I left satisfied.\",\"Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back.\",\"This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. \\\\n\\\\nThe bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.\\\\n\\\\nIf not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.\\\\n\\\\nI think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPS. The whole joint smells like major B.O.\",\"I have mixed feelings about this place. I wish I could give 2.5 stars, but I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up today. \\\\n\\\\nThis was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. \\\\n\\\\nWe were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were \\\\\\\"meant to be shared.\\\\\\\" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a \\\\\\\"here's your sauce\\\\\\\" kind of way. I remember thinking, \\\\\\\"That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce.\\\\\\\" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. \\\\n\\\\nForget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were \\\\\\\"meant to be shared\\\\\\\" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. \\\\n\\\\nOverall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. The music didn't fit the ambiance. Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. The restaurant was loud and crowded. The girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck-face puckered lip pictures...  \\\\n\\\\nI think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant, but no such luck.\",\"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!\",\"Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \\\\\\\"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\\\\\\\". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!\",\"Walked in tonight, Wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  The phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. When she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  Didn't say a word to us. Unbelievable!  Will not be back there-- rude hostess!\",\"Disappointing. \\\\n\\\\nMy bf and I went for JUST dessert and wine, which we told the hostess ahead of time. The waitress was very curt and disrespectful. We were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was NOT closing time). She did not offer suggestions or advice.\\\\n\\\\nWe ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.\\\\n\\\\nThe waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it.\",\"Let me start by saying that I do like their food. \\\\n\\\\nLast night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was undercooked, and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.\\\\n(is that the way rice is prepared now?)\\\\n\\\\nI ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better.\\\\n\\\\n4 people, not crowded...2 hours total.\",\"A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \\\\n\\\\nThe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\\\\n\\\\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.\",\"Sandy had me holed up in Pittsburgh looking for a flight and staying with my wife's aunt. She adventurously agreed to go with me to a veggie place and that's how I ended up here. \\\\n\\\\nNice layout with tables along the windows and more in back. If you're not familiar with this kind of scene it could seem a little rundown, but to my eyes it was fine. Really, it's kind of the proto-typical East Coast college town vegetarian hangout.\\\\n\\\\nThe aunt-in-law is a meateater and in her seventies, but she really enjoyed her tempeh Cubano.

Small and cozy very nice and relaxing afternoon!  To just enjoy with yourself and a friend!\",\"I've really enjoyed their pizza so far. I also ordered a chicken salad and it was tasty for a pizza take out place, nothing too fancy. I have only had the food at this place by delivery and it has always come before and hour has passed. The pizza always comes warm and ready to eat. Nothing to complain about. I did give it only 4 stars because there are a couple of other places that serve homemade ranch on the side which makes the pizza taste even extra delicious.\",\"I don't care what Cub and Bulls fans think, this Steeler and Penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. First, the crust tastes like a biscuit, and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. I will give UNOs a thumbs up on it's flatbread, it's better pizza than some pizzerias In the area. When I look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me, this place is a dud. Guess what?

When the owners are there, it's really good. When they aren't, you get pizza that is over cooked (more like burnt) and LONG delivery times. The pizza, even when plain, is very greasy. Way more than other places around. Usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese. Also they do not take credit or debit cards. There are better options.\",\"By far my favorite Pizza place in the east end.  The buffalo chicken pizza here is fantastic, and very unique.  I haven't been able to find anything even remotely approaches it in other cities.  \\\\n\\\\nThe place is a bit pricey, but I feel its worth it.  My go to pizza delivery place!\",\"Decent neighborhood pizza can be found in morningside at eddies pizza haus. The sauce and cheese are perfect, but the crust falls short.  It has a nice texture and overall the pizza isn't greasy, but the crust lacks much flavor. Maybe a little more salt is needed in the dough to compensate? The pizza is decent enough though and merits a try, perhaps it was an off day for Eddies.\",\"Pizza Parma delivers through GrubHub, which is the primary reason I ordered sandwiches from them. BBQ chicken was ok. The bread is a little more on the burnt than toasted side, leading it to be dry. The value is good. The 20\\\\\\\" sandwich was about $11.\",\"All in favor of a deep dish pizza say I!.......IIIIIII,  ok now that i have that out of my system. This place is such a great hangout/eat-in spot. I hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.\\\\n\\\\nWe arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches. \\\\n\\\\nAfter ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.\\\\n\\\\nI'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. \\\\n\\\\nWe came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come. \\\\n\\\\nOnly down side is slow service. It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked. He got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor!!\",\"I had the deep dish pizza and it was very good!  The individual size was smaller Than I expected for $12 but I wasn't starving so it was very filling.  Our waitress April was very nice and attentive for how busy it was.  We had about a 30 minute wait but it was worth it!  I can't wait to try it again!\",\"Horrible Food don't waste your money\\\\n\\\\nThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\\\\n\\\\nLoudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong.

I ordered the Milano special pizza, which had pepperoni, bacon, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc, and the popcorn chicken. The order itself arrived within thirty minutes which was great. Although the pizza tasted decent, the crust was not crispy at all, the slices were pretty floppy. They also skimped on the toppings a bit. I was hoping for a more loaded pizza. I'm not watching my weight--I can handle it. As far as the popcorn chicken goes, it was too salty, even with the honey Dijon dipping sauce. Probably not ordering from here again.\",\"Pizza Parma has many of the characteristics I like in a pizza joint. \\\\n1) They deliver when they say they will, \\\\n2) Diverse menu and toppings, \\\\n3) Coupons, \\\\n4) Online ordering, and \\\\n5) Take credit cards. \\\\n\\\\nI think Pizza Parma shines with their specialty pizzas. Artichoke, Buffalo Chicken, Spinach & Feta, and Greek pies are all delicious. I've also had some of their pasta dishes, and I can't complain. It's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. Pizza Parma fails on wings, though. The texture is unappealing (aka, flappy chicken skin-- yuk!), and the sauces lack depth. Desserts are also not worth the buy.\",\"All around delicious pizza, hoagie, apps place.  Always good. Consistent.  Can vouch for any pizza, Italian hoagie, jalape\\\\u00f1o poppers and fried mushrooms. All good.  Do yourself a favor and order perfecta.\",\"Some friends and I ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery from here tonight.  We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment, and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  My friend suggested getting pizza from here, and I didn't object, since I'd never had pizza from here before, and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.\\\\n\\\\nThe pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there.  As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).\\\\n\\\\nAs the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). It was better than Vocelli's, and about on par with Papa John's.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again, but I wouldn't object to it, either.\",\"I called for a delivery of a pepperoni pizza, large. Very simple since I was in the mood for it. The delivery and the time taken were exceptional. Very fast, very good delivery service. \\\\n\\\\nThe down side is the pizza. It was hot and fresh, but the flavor was just OK. It wasn't the best nor was it the worst. It was just OK.\\\\n\\\\nIf you do find that you like your pizza and need a quick delivery, you can't go wrong here. Other than that you may want to look elsewhere.\",\"For $10 you can get an 8 inch sub and a GIANT slice of pizza. Needless to say, this has become my favorite place to order dinner from.\",\"Papa J's is expensive and inconsistent.  The ambiance is nice but it doesn't justify the prices.  There are better restaurants in Carnegie.\",\"This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much, so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best I can come up with is as follows. Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... It's possible, although unlikely based on what I've seen.\\\\n\\\\nOn the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave.\",\"Three stars is super accurate for this place. We decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken BUBBA SHOW (does that plug raise anyone else's blood pressure??) Our order was ready in 15 minutes (speedy!) and we got a large 1 topping pizza for ~$8 and a side of fries. All together like $13 for three people, which is pretty good. As for the pizza, the crust was crispy and not too thick or thin, and the sauce was sweet, not seasoned. I prefer a more herby sauce myself, so I wasn't wowed by it. The fries were a bit soggy, but tasty. Overall, if I were in a pinch I'd order from here no problem but it's not a place I'd set out to order from because I love it.\",\"Great Hoagies! \\\\n\\\\nI always get the Steak Deluxe hoagie and my wife gets the Italian Deluxe and then we give each other half of the other ones hoagie because we can never decide on with one to get.\",\"I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. I went here around 12am on a Friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. I ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. The fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. There are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. \\\\n\\\\nThe people working there are really nice though which is a plus. Overall, i wouldn't go back.\",\"Worst pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered from here last weekend. The pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. The Buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily I had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. \\\\n\\\\nMaybe it was one bad night, and I can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, I can't recommend this place to anyone.\",\"Great pizza, reasonable prices, fast service - cant ask for much more!\",\"This is the greasiest pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh, I couldn't eat it.\",\"The food and customer service from this restaurant are really top notch.  I am continually impressed with how fast the delivery is and how likeable the drivers are.\\\\n\\\\nThe pizzas here are excellent as long as you don't get the \\\\\\\"crab meat\\\\\\\" topping (I should have expected gross imitation crab meat since we're so far from the coast).\\\\n\\\\nThe breadsticks, jalapeno poppers, and wings are also delicious.\\\\n\\\\nSome of the best pizza in Pennsylvania.\",\"What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\\\\n\\\\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\\\\n\\\\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \\\\n\\\\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \\\\n\\\\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \\\\n\\\\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \\\\n\\\\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\\\\n\\\\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\\\\n\\\\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!\",\"Okay so I just moved to the outskirts of Duquesne, PA which is outside of Pittsburgh from Harrisburg, PA of all places. Where I am at, really there is no delivery but these guys did. They were nice and cordial and cheap but I have been spoiled by the pizza shop in Harrisburg, Downtown, run my an old world Italian guy named Luigi. That pizza is/was MILES better than this. This crust, while thin, did not have flavor and was hard. The slices were small for their 8 slice which I did like. The cheese was good. The sauce was meh. I've definitely had way better. 2 stars for being cheap and delivering.\",\"I had heard lots of good things about Vento's. Unfortunately I did not get to experience these things. The service was slow and lukewarm. The pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. Also, no credit or debit cards here.  You're directed to the ATM in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   I ordered ahead and although I had to wait for my pizza when I got there I received it cold and it just was not that good.  I also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good.\",\"I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me \\\\\\\"Stay out of trouble\\\\\\\".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\\\\n\\\\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.  I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.\",\"I like the pizza and the selection of toppings.  They are reliable.  Great option for take out food.\",\"The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. For 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over $50 bucks. The personal pizzas alone were $11 each... If you want pizza and beer go somewhere else-pasta appetizers, or sandwiches... this place is good.\",\"I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\\\\n\\\\nFrench onion\\\\nChicken bites\\\\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\\\\n\\\\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. \\\\n\\\\nI really never want to return.\",\"I love N.Y. style pizza.  Could eat it every day.  On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.  \\\\n\\\\nOne thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.\\\\n\\\\nThe pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:\\\\nFiori's\\\\nPizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)\\\\nPizza Perfectta\\\\nAiello's (Murray Street)\\\\nBeto's\\\\n\\\\nSave for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.\\\\n\\\\nPizza Perfectta has a few stools and a counter but really it is a take-out place.\",\"Based on some recent reviews, it looks like the quality of food at Minutellos has slipped a little bit.  Still as I mentioned before, it's a Shadyside institution located in the basement of an apartment building.  \\\\n\\\\nAnyway, the main reason to come to Minutellos is for the pizza.  My cousin and I did just that the other night when we were in the area.  We did the whole 'Build Your Own Pizza' thing, ordering ours with pepperoni, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Good pizza even if the place is beginning to look a little dated.\",\"Yay, I'm a fan of the white pizza.  Had take out.  \\\\n\\\\nThe bar was jumping when I picked up our order.\\\\n\\\\nThe white pizza is so delicious...with garlic, spinach, feta, and added some veggies.  Tried the Roman Style calamari, very good better than the fried calamari we had last time.\",\"Good pizza and hoagies.  It is always busy.  Cash only.\",\"I had some pizza from Pizza Parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  A colleague brought it in, so I didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  I had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  Nothing special, nothing especially good or bad.  Crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin.  It was a little greasy, and quite cheesy as well.  I was starving so I really enjoyed it, but I think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  Still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, I'd say go for it.  Just don't have very high expectations.\",\"My friend and I have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. For a Thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. There were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. We ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken, hamburger and pepperoni (for him) while the other side had just pepperoni (for me). I was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory. I even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist, not dried out. This wasn't bad for a first visit so I will definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. I'm only giving Uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. Hello! The plate was yellow! How could she not have seen that?!\",\"We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not slices. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\\\\nIt also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again!\",\"This Valentines Day I ordered a pizza for my boyfriend and asked that they make a heart on it out of green peppers. The pizza was great, the heart was perfect, and he loved it!\",\"Home of the Italian Army.\\\\n\\\\nVento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.\\\\n\\\\nThey have tables and booths for seating. You can even play the PA lottery there. \\\\n\\\\nNo debit or credit cards. CASH ONLY!\\\\n\\\\n(F.Y.I. There is a generic ATM that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)\",\"In all fairness, I went to this place after stuffing myself at Vincent's Pizza Park.  Still, I know a good pizza when I see one, and this place is totally passable, but great or even good it is not.  My friend and I were given our pizza in a box although we were planning on eating on the premises.  Still, it seemed like we were not wanted and decided not to press the point.  We walked across the street to a parking lot and saw a Pizza Perfecttta box and some leftover pizza littered on the ground.  In the end we didn't finish our pizza and assumed that many people in the past have been hastily handed their pizza, pushed out the door, only to walk across the street, eat mediocre pizza, and decide it wasn't even worth the energy to pick it up and throw it away.\",\"This was one of first pizza places that I've tried inPittsburgh. It was about 5 years ago. I don't have a clear memory of that time but I have Parma pizza phobia ever since... So go figure...\",\"Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more, namely because I've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. Luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in a comfortable setting. It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.\\\\n\\\\nI've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. It's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.\\\\n\\\\nThe portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to Sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering Chef Boyardee either. The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. \\\\n\\\\nThe crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.\\\\n\\\\nI've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.\\\\n\\\\nAnd for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for. A place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense. \\\\n\\\\nAnd that is exactly what Luigi's is.\",\"Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\\\\\\\" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \\\\\\\"steak\\\\\\\" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \\\\n\\\\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!\",\"This is a Pittsburgh/Shadyside institution.\\\\n\\\\nWhat can I say, this place is good-eatin' basic Italian food!  Not spectacular, but when you want a good nuthin-fancy dinner, this is the place to go.  The pizza is outstanding.\",\"Pizza ok on it's own nothing great . Definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria UNO in Chicago. Are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark.\",\"Provolone sticks arrived undercooked, cheese was fully solid, they tasted okay.

Awful! My car wouldn't start so I called the tow and he managed to get it started, but it's been acting up so I brought it in anyways.

When I went to pick it up, I turned it on and before I could even leave the lot, it died! I went back in and told him that the tow truck operator hooked it up to a jumper box and pumped the gas to start it. That's what he did. Then told me it probably didn't start because it was sitting so long. Then he told me \\\\\\\"I don't know anything about your car\\\\\\\"!

THEY ADMITTEDLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CARS!\",\"I was just there this morning for a 10am appointment to get my summer tires swapped out for my winter tires.  My regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on Monday.  Receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable, so I said OK.  Upon arrival, store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts.  He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work.  I asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty.  I had heart surgery a while back and I can't do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incision/breastplate, if this was not the case with my health, I'd certainly take care of it.  Aftermarket rims are common - should not be an issue.  Last time I ever set foot in that place.\",\"I took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections.  First I was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall.  Secondly I was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off.   I was quoted $425 for them to get it off.  I was able to accomplish this with a $6 bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen I returned to have the reinspection I was charged for it (their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within 30 days of initially failing free of charge).  This time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on.  This was odd as I had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass.  They once again quoted me $425, stating they would have to replace the wheel stud.  The new wheel stud cost me $3.50 at the local parts store and I did the job in under an hour without a single power tool.  \\\\n\\\\nThis shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs.

However, this time was very different. I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, \\\\\\\"oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday\\\\\\\". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. \\\\n\\\\nI soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, \\\\\\\"oh, and we don't take checks\\\\\\\". \\\\n\\\\nThe next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, \\\\\\\"yes, of course\\\\\\\". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times.\",\"Don't go.

The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. \\\\n\\\\nThis week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare! I called Monro early this morning to see if I could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest. I needed my car so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). \\\\n\\\\nI drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. \\\\n\\\\nAfter paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they \\\\\\\"would work with me\\\\\\\". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed? \\\\n\\\\nIf you need tires go to Pep Boys on Milvalle. If you need an oil change go to Midas on Penn Circle they'll be able to get you in and not wait three days.\",\"I had a great experience taking my vehicle to Mike's for repair after a fender bender. I used the Geico express service - I booked the estimate and repair online for the next day. When I dropped off my car, they were expecting me, it took less than 30 minutes and every single person I encountered at the shop was helpful and friendly and showed concern for me. The damage was minor, and the repairs took less than 48 hours to complete. My policy provides a rental car, and Enterprise was there when I checked in with my vehicle and the rental process was streamlined and easy. When I picked up my repaired car, it was just as efficient and friendly. Getting into an accident is frustrating and inconvenient and costly but Mike's Auto Body made the process of fixing things and getting me back on the road into a good experience. I wish more businesses treated their customers like Mike's treated me.\",\"Scenario: Get into my car at 3:30 and head to campus for a meeting. All of a sudden, the tire warning signal lights up even though I don't remember running over anything. I get out of the car to carefully inspect my tires and they feel/look completely OK. But after owning a BMW for 3 years and having constant wheel alignment/tire issues (ie. when a tire warning signal lights up, it usually means my tire's about to blow out!!), I freaked out and frantically drove my Infiniti to the first 3 auto shops on Baum Blvd. I waited at the first stop for 5-10 minutes and the guy did not get off the phone. I got back into the car and drove it over to Pep Boy's where a mechanic was outside smoking. He says I need to go through their service desk (inside their huge store) and deal with them first. I'm thinking, \\\\\\\"ugh. no time. I have class in 40 minutes and I'm already late to my meeting.\\\\\\\" I drive past the 3rd shop and I don't even see anyone sitting at the reception desk and figure it's going to take forever to get what I'm asking for.\\\\n\\\\nThen, I remembered the really positive experience I had with Walter's. I decided to drive to the end of Baum Blvd. to find his place and boy, am I glad I did. As soon as I got there, the service coordinator told me to pull my car around front so that their mechanic could take a look at my tires. He stopped what he was doing to do this and told me I could just stay in my car. Then, he reassured me that my tires were OK and he proceeded to inflate them, explaining to me why the signals might have come on.\\\\n\\\\nFree of charge, in and out within 5 minutes, and helpful/reassuring. I love this about Walter's Automative. They're not out just to make money. They genuinely just want to help. Highly reccommend!!\",\"Extremely honest, great work and amazing prices. I had them repair a wheel issue on my car. For no charge the mechanic also hid some wires I never got around to moving for the DYI back-up camera I installed.\",\"Tire replacement, was told it would take about 1.5 hours (when I had an existing appointment). It's almost been 2.5 hours and I'm still waiting. Ridiculous.\",\"I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.\\\\n\\\\nCoincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?\\\\n\\\\nWell, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  \\\\n\\\\nSo no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.\\\\n\\\\nFortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.  Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all.\",\"I can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at Paul's Clock Repair.  I needed an Atmos clock repaired, which was given to me by my mother who had recently passed away.  I needed it done on a short time line since I live out-of-town and was leaving soon.  It is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where I live.  They were so accommodating and really really helped me out during a hard time.  Much thanks to Lisa for spending the time to teach my about the clock & how to take care of it and her dad for fixing it up!  My Atmos clock is now working great and looks wonderful on my mantle!\",\"I thought I need an alignment and turns out all I needed was a tire balance. I stopped by he had me go with him and we drove around the block. I didn't cost me a thing because the tire balance was under warranty. Really  nice guy.\",\"This place is a disaster. I made an appointment online for 5:30PM. When I got there they refused me service, asserting they close at 6:00PM. Nevermind that online published hours are from 7AM to 7PM. Furthermore, their own system sent me a confirmation email for my 5:30PM appointment. Finally, this building is an absolute dump... Goodyear should be ashamed to have the brand attached to it.\",\"Poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own. When asked to repair something, Rockwel Realty will do it on their terms and refuse to give you notice of when they will enter your apartment despite multiple requests\\\\n\\\\nWhen asked to clean mildew, they did in fact clean it with bleach while also spilling bleach on my sheets and ruining them. When told about this problem and that the mildew returned they said it was my fault for not turning the heat up and that damage done during service is an inherent risk the tenant is responsible for and nothing could be done. Their solution was for me to clean the mildew instead of properly insulating the unit to prevent mildew. \\\\n\\\\nThe entire building also has severe electrical problems that causes all lights to be replaced twice a month. No permanent fixes are made to existing units, but there is constant construction to expand an old building so they can collect more rent.\",\"I moved to Pgh from San Francisco in 2010, and every single dealing I've had with AAA since I moved here has been great -- straightforward, super helpful people, and mostly quite brief wait times. \\\\n\\\\nThe agent that I have worked with from the start, whose name I think is Heather (long dark hair, second desk from the left), has always been willing to spend as much time with me as I needed to understand what I was buying and/or the process that I needed to go through.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. I had a check for the full amount in less than a week.\\\\n\\\\nI see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related. I don't know if those people are even AAA employees, they might be DOT for all we know. I've had three title transactions, including one for a car that was from out of state, and they all went smoothly. \\\\n\\\\nI've been with AAA for more than 40 years, and when I lived in California I was seriously considering switching. Not anymore.\",\"Great on line service!!!  2nd time placing an order on line and they made it easy as far as getting the correct sizes in a timely manner.\",\"The people that work here make an unfortunate incident a breeze to work through.  I woke up one morning to find a note attached to my windshield to inform me that I was the victim of a hit and run.  The damage was minimal, but after calling it into my insurance company, they directed me to come here.\\\\n\\\\nWithin minutes of me hanging up my phone with the insurance company my phone was ringing to indicate that Mikes was calling to set up an appointment to get my car in for an estimate.  I set up an appointment that was convenient for me and went about my day.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I arrived here to have my car viewed it was quite the easy task.  My wait was minimal, the staff were polite and I wasn't being jerked around.  Within five minutes of them looking at my car, I was out the door and heading back to my place.  \\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, they did not do any work to my vehicle at this point because the police are still looking into the person that hit my car.  But if we get to that step, I am confident that they could not do anything wrong in my eyes.  If their body work for a vehicle is anything like their customer service, they are definitely one of the best places to go in the city.\\\\n\\\\nYes people, this isn't the best neighborhood in the city, but get over it.\",\"Honest. Reliable. Trust Worthy.\\\\n\\\\nTim goes above and beyond with his service. He came to my house 3x one day to check everything he could before I ended up towing it to the garage. I will definitely go back!\",\"Thank You Kim and Kurt! It was very nice of you guys to take the time to post your reviews on our service. We really appreciate it. We hope your clocks will continue to do well for years to come. Please dont hesitate to give us a call if there's anything else we can do for you.\\\\n\\\\nLisa\\\\nPaul's Clock Repair\",\"The most important quality a mechanic can have is honesty. Meet Tim Walter. When I take my car to Walter's I know the service will be good, fast and won't take a chunk out of my last paycheck. Calling ahead is usually a good idea so they can fit you in...\",\"Made an appointment for 3:30. They completely forgot I was coming but said they could start on my car in ten minutes and be done in an hour. Came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot. They said it would take another two hours to start work. Completely unhelpful and unapologetic.\",\"I went here to get my serpentine belt replaced and a transmission flushed and these guys were friendly and efficient.  They took the time to explain things to me and I felt comfortable that they were making the appropriate recommendations without trying to charge me for things I didn't need.  It was ready in just a few hours as promised so I was able to pick it up same day.  Only complaint is that they left my transmission fluid dipstick out of place under the hood so it was just laying on top, but fortunately it didn't fall down and screw up anything since it was laying flat on the top, but if it had that could've been a more serious problem.  So I subtracted a star for that since it seemed a bit careless.\",\"I just want to echo what everyone else has already said about this mechanic.  My brakes gave out and I came upon the glowing reviews for Walter's, so I gave them a call.  Not only did Tim fix my car quickly and inexpensively, he actually came to pick it up himself so that I wouldn't have to spend money on a tow truck!  He's also an extremely friendly, funny guy who puts you at ease immediately.  I'll be going back there without hesitation the next time I need anything done on my car.\",\"I took my car to Mike's auto body as it's recommended by Geico and is part of their easy claims and repair process.  This was a big mistake.  Like many of the reviewers here, I was initially told it would take a certain amount of time, and then, at the last minute, on the day I was supposed to get my car back, they told me it would be a few more days.  Their excuse?  The headlamp that came in didn't have a bulb with it.  Seriously?  Since this was the Geico rep telling me this I couldn't really argue, but I don't know why Geico keeps working with a business that repeatedly does this to its customers.\\\\n\\\\nI got the car back in great condition, cleaned on the outside, and the console wiped down inside.  All in all, just alright - go here if you're not pressed for time and you've got Geico, otherwise shop around.\",\"When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \\\\n\\\\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \\\\n\\\\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\\\\\\\"S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\\\\n\\\\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \\\\\\\"Should be ready in a few days\\\\\\\". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \\\\\\\"duke it over\\\\\\\" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?\",\"I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there!  I waited for five minutes (in the rain), and they still didn't show.  I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment).  I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, \\\\\\\"Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.'  Seriously?  When I was waiting, another woman came to the door.  I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in!  When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place.  I couldn't believe it.  This place is the worst, and I have never even stepped inside!\",\"I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had nothing better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you.\\\\n\\\\nYou pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.\\\\n\\\\nI'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.\\\\n\\\\nUpon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.\\\\n\\\\nAnd that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.\\\\n\\\\nTip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience.\",\"I had to get new tires mounted and balanced and when I went to pay, the guy at the register actually says something to the effect of \\\\\\\"Do you have any idea what this is supposed to cost? So, I could charge you $400 and you wouldn't know the difference?\\\\\\\" Joking or not, why even go there?\",\"I have an older car and so sometimes things go wonky. One night I had to drop it off because it was barely running and I had no idea why. This was the first time I went to Walter's, turns out that it was only an oil changing problem. Car places usually screw me over because I know nothing about cars, but Walters did not. They are really great and fix the car for your needs. Yesterday I returned for inspection and once again he treated me fairly and only mentioned things that I already knew needed work. I would recommend this place to anyone with an older car and wants an honest car repair man. Walter's will definitely be getting my business in the future!\",\"This place is looking to make money and rip you off.  The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection.  Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it, but this place said they would not pass it.  Weird how it passed inspection 3 times already with no other place mentioning the door being a problem.  Never giving this place any business again, I went to a different Meineke in Homestead where they are helpful and work with you.\",\"Great customer service.  I was in Pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport.  I found these guys on Yelp, and the reviews were not wrong.  It was easy to order the car and pick-up was prompt.\",\"Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.  Since they don\\\\\\\"t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours.  Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair,  They lost my business for good.\",\"Hands down a great experience! I called yesterday as the driver headlight on my car was out and asked if I needed to make an appointment. The woman on the phone said to just stop right by during their hours. I went by this morning and their (small) lot was full so I just sat in my car while I believe who was Tim was finished chatting with another guy. I continued to sat in my car for a couple of minutes while Tim quickly inspected my headlight. Unfortunately he did not have any replacement bulbs but ordered them right on the spot while I was there and told me to come back any time in the afternoon. Fast forward a few hours later. I  just popped by and after popping my hood and going into their office to pay, my headlight was replaced! Friendly, honest, fair and quick service. No BS. Highly recommend Walter's Automotive.\",\"I'm a lawyer in NY and I'm visiting a friend in Pittsburgh. I am blown away by the code violations in this unit.

If you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, Casbah is it.\",\"My boyfriend took me to Casbah for my birthday this March. This is one of our twice-a-year splurges and I have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages.\\\\nWe were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same.\\\\nWe started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. \\\\nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day!\\\\nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \\\\\\\"fishy\\\\\\\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. \\\\nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.\\\\nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna!\",\"great atmosphere and great food. while the menu changes seasonally, my group all enjoyed the food - crab/scallop pasta, pumpkin risotto and rare tuna.\\\\n\\\\ncasbah also has a great wine list, and great service that is there when you need them, but doesn't annoy.\",\"I was underwhelmed with our dining experience. We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.\\\\n\\\\nMenu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy. \\\\n\\\\nI might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price I will dine on entrees elsewhere.\",\"Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.  I reaffirm my previous comments.\\\\n\\\\nGood service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the coffee is great, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.  The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good...  seriously, this meat is a fork cutting affair.  However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.\\\\n\\\\nAs with Eleven, you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix, so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door!\",\"Glad to see that the Big Burrito restaurants are alive and well in Pittsburgh, and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishments.\\\\n\\\\nBit of a complex review.  My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.\\\\n\\\\nWe sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.\\\\n\\\\nLots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following.\",\"CASH ONLY!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  The place seems to have some spacial issues.  There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol, more of a coffee/diner bar.  The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable, but maybe this is by design.  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.  Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not stop.  It was savory, spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night.    This is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to time.\",\"Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive!\",\"My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal. My mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and I to a Portuguese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went, looked at the menu and did not find anything Portuguese on the menu. Why does this restaurant promote itself as Portuguese, fly the Portuguese flag and not have ANY Portuguese dishes. We left.\",\"Casbah is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable. \\\\n\\\\nThe calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do! \\\\n\\\\nThe pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive. I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean plates at the end of the meal. \\\\n\\\\nI like the fact that it seems like the menu changes with the seasons. The proteins may stay static, but since they use a lot of local ingredients, the accompaniments/side dishes might be different every time you come. Honestly, this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. I plan on trying it for brunch or lunch sometime soon.\",\"I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday, for which we decided to use at Casbah a few weeks ago. It was my first time there, though I've tried a few other BB restaurants in the past. \\\\n\\\\nFood: \\\\n- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!\\\\n- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking\\\\n- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again\\\\n- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.\\\\n- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  \\\\ncaramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.\\\\n\\\\nService: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron. They were very accommodating in this way. \\\\n\\\\nWill I go back? Someday - but I think I may try Soba or Kaya first.\",\"Meh.  Seriously?  Mediterranean?  What?  Sorry, but just because you serve scallops on babah ganoush doesn't make your restaurant Mediterranean.\\\\n\\\\nThis was kind of a disappointment, if you couldn't tell by my sarcastic tone.  The food was good, and I had a great time, but the food lacked the final eyebrow raising component that you come to expect with the bill that follows.\\\\n\\\\nThat said, the wine list was good and the prices were reasonable relative to the food.  Get the cheese course for dessert and you'll go home happy.\",\"Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!\\\\n\\\\nOur meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).\\\\n\\\\nMy two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.\\\\n\\\\nAfter our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with \\\\\\\"Happy birthday\\\\\\\" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.\\\\n\\\\nWe visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.\\\\n\\\\nIn sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!\",\"Amazing brunch! I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.\\\\n\\\\nFor $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. \\\\n\\\\nI started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\\\\n\\\\nI tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.\\\\n\\\\nFor brunch in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. Not to be missed!\\\\n\\\\nNow I just need to make plans to go back for dinner.\",\"Sharia don't like it, and neither does Becky. \\\\n\\\\nBoy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. \\\\n\\\\nWe shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. \\\\n\\\\nMany yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. \\\\n\\\\nI had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. \\\\n\\\\nWe glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag.\",\"I was treated to Casbah for lunch by a potential employer who had passed me over, but really, really liked me. She said it was her favorite restaurant, but that she didn't go as often as she'd like.\\\\n\\\\nI knew the building from the early 80's when it had been one of Pittsburgh's dive gay bars called 'The Tender Trap', and knowing this, as well as a lot about the Big Bistroid Group...oops...Big BURRITO Group, I was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual Big Burrito hype.  And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.\\\\n\\\\nThe atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.\\\\n\\\\nThe service was good. Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.\\\\n\\\\nThe menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings.  My friend had a salmon salad, and I opted to try the Farm Lamb Mac-n-Cheese.  The waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread.  For a beverage, we both opted for just water.\\\\n\\\\nI have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed.  \\\\n\\\\nFor LUNCH, the prices were all around the $15 range, and the portions were NOT large.  The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.\\\\n\\\\nI can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.\\\\n\\\\nThe Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.\\\\n\\\\nBasically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.\\\\n\\\\nSeriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!\\\\n\\\\nI also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.\\\\n\\\\nI can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.  \\\\n\\\\nI'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion. \\\\n\\\\nWho are all of these easily dupe-able rich people, and where do they come from? Want to blow that kind of money? Get out your check book and let me give you my address!\",\"The adjectives that come to mind when I think of Cafe Zinho are cute, quaint, cozy and in a random area. I don't think I would have stumbled upon this place just upon chance. I made a reservation for three on a Tuesday night at 7. My two friends were already there and then... there was just me in the restaurant, which scared me a little bit but I have to have faith in my fellow Yelpers. \\\\n\\\\nThe waitress was an adorable woman who was so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about the dishes in a quiet manner. You just wanted to pinch her cheeks or something. Anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet, unlike many of the other restaurants breads that I have had, which I enjoyed. We ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey deliciousness and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that night which had capers, a potato, rice and some roasted vegetables. Great light combination and not too heavy. The size of the sea bass was like of the entire whole fish. To top it off we had the rice pudding dessert which was similar to flan but I thought this was so tasty. I kind of want one right now as I am typing this review.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI am so glad I went to Cafe Zinho finally and would happily come back here again.\",\"I finally went to Casbah for brunch today. Rolled in at 10am to meet a handful of people. Because it is Labor Day weekend, the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy. We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree. Portions were large, atmosphere was cool, food was good and wait staff were awesome but in the end I don't think $24 (not including the tip and tax) was worth it.\",\"Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. Everything looked great on the menu, but execution was flawed through out our meal. Also, their dishes are not really Portuguese.\\\\n\\\\nFor appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.\\\\n\\\\nEntrees were, on the whole, not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked). The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor. The lamb burger was also overcooked.\",\"Top points. \\\\nService. I was there with a large group for a meeting. They gave us a private room and two servers took care of us. They were efficient and very accommodating. Kudos. \\\\n\\\\nAppetizers: had the crab dip and calamari. Both were good. Servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed. I'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. Dip was good. Calamari was done well. Preferred the shrimp cocktail Sauce with it versus the Asian type soy sauce that is served with it. \\\\n\\\\nWedge salad with bleu cheese. Waaaaaay too much cheese and I like bleu cheese. \\\\n\\\\nI had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! Green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. Simple green beans would have been more appetizing. \\\\nTuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. Was not over cooked. Potatoes as expected. \\\\nOther dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. Would be nice if this was offered broiled as well. Crab cakes and filet looked okay. \\\\n\\\\nOverall I'm always underwhelmed and overcharged here. I guess with chain places you get that, but I want more from a place that charges me 25 bucks for sub-seared tuna.\",\"This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. \\\\n\\\\nGotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. \\\\n\\\\nWhat I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a \\\\\\\"Mediterranean\\\\\\\" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. \\\\n\\\\nI do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!\\\\n\\\\nSo pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!\",\"The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a \\\\\\\"foodie\\\\\\\" palate, don't even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it.\",\"Brunch = best in the burgh.  Hands down.  Best. eggs. ever. I am not even sure how the eggs can be that good.  I know what you are saying, \\\\\\\"They are eggs, Jessica.  Get a grip.\\\\\\\"  No.  I will not.  I cannot.  I want to stand on top of rooftops and shout my love for these eggs all over town.  \\\\n\\\\nJ, H and I went there a few Sundays ago.  We all got the same thing. When was the last time you went to a meal and all three people ordered the same thing.  It was that good.  The scallop breakfast is out of this world.  2 perfectly cooked scallops, scrambled eggs (the eggs!!!), the creamiest, tastiest grits in the world, buttery croissant and sausage, apples and butternut squash.  Don't think those things go together?  They do and are awesome!  J and I also both got orders of bacon cause no brunch is complete without bacon.  \\\\n\\\\nOur service was also great.  Nice hostess, awesome waiter.  All was perfect.  \\\\n\\\\nReally freaking good brunch.  Really.  Cannot say enough about those freaking eggs.  \\\\n\\\\nOh, but don't order an additional mimosa from the deal - they are $8 a piece which is a bit steep.\",\"My husband and I went to Casbah to celebrate my birthday one evening.  We were seated on the patio which was fine before a party of 20 was seated with a 1 year old who was banging his silverware on the table all night.  So much for romantic!  Ever hear of a babysitter?  Anyway, ambience aside, let's get to the food which overall I would give a C+.  We started with the veal and pork meatballs which were the highlight of the meal.  The perfect blend of sweet (fresh tomato sauce) and spicy -- the meatballs had a nice tang, and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasn't much of it there.  We each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless.  I grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. These tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in December.  Very disappointing.  I opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu.  It was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.  Another disappointment.  My husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food.  All this said, the service was professional, we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and I their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine.  I might return here for happy hour but it was not the right choice for a romantic special occasion dinner.  And we had the decency to hire a babysitter for our children, otherwise we would have stayed home.\",\"The interior is very nice. The food is a hit or miss. We went for brunch today. You can select a drink (alcoholic or non), an appetizer, and a brunch entree for the price of $22. The appetizers we had (pollenta and squash&chestnut soup) were very good. The entrees, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. We got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet. The omelet was very bland. It did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. Basically, I have had better omelets at some Denny's. My drink mimosa was just OK. My girlfriend's blood mary was delicious, though -- uniquely spicy. \\\\n\\\\nI have been to Casbah 4 times, last time being for brunch today. The first time, it was good, worthy of 4 stars. It gradually went down to 3 stars. The wine selection is good. But the food is definitely hit or miss. Once I had a halibut that smelled like the ocean. It was not well cooked or fresh, or something. Consistency is the key in a nice restaurant; Casbah leaves much to be desired in this regard.\",\"I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New Year's Eve 2012... What a terrible judgment call that was on my part. So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  I still regularly dream of this restaurant. Do I dare say it's my favorite restaurant? I'm not sure, but if it's not my favorite, it's certainly close.\\\\n\\\\nWe returned after NYE last year to celebrate my birthday in March, making sure to bring along the oh-so-coveted Big Burrito birthday coupon. I ordered the Orecchiette with Chicken, Cranberries, Goat Cheese & Sage Cream. Oh. My. Goodness. Don't order this if you're on a diet... but order this if you love delicious food and living life to the fullest. It was ridiculously creamy, and the cranberries packed the perfect fruity balance to the rich dish. My husband ordered the Double-Cut Pork Chop with Kale & Butternut Squash Risotto. While recently dining at a highly rated restaurant in NYC, he said, \\\\\\\"My double-cut pork chop at Casbah was better than this double-cut pork chop.\\\\\\\" That's when I knew that I needed to update my review of Casbah.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, my delicious birthday dinner ended with the Dark Chocolate-Raspberry Bread Pudding. I love ordering bread pudding at restaurants, and I think this is the best of them all. I would confidently enter this dessert in a bread pudding competition, knowing that I would be walking away with the blue ribbon.\",\"Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm.  It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. \\\\n\\\\nI immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. \\\\n\\\\nI started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was ok. \\\\n\\\\nFor the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.\\\\n\\\\nFor the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.\\\\n\\\\nThe cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. \\\\n\\\\nLastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. \\\\n\\\\nService was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent. \\\\n\\\\nThis place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn't go back for that price.\",\"Casbah continues to be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. High quality service and creative dishes. Sign up for mailers for Big Burrito special offers and birthday discount.  \\\\n\\\\nMust try:\\\\nCalamari\\\\nCheese plate\\\\nShort Rib Ravioli\\\\nPork Chop\\\\nWatermelon Gin Fizz\",\"My wife and I go to Casbah every year for my birthday. It is my favorite of the Big  Burrito restaurants, and they have a birthday deal for $30 off an entree. \\\\n\\\\nThis time I started with the Parsnip & Chestnut Soup, garnished with braised chicken, arugula & almond pesto. It was divine, with the rich sweetness for which parsnips are noted. My main course was Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with flageolet beans, merguez sausage, turnips, greens and whole grain mustard. It was cooked perfectly pink, as ordered, and the flavors complemented each other.\\\\n\\\\nFor dessert, I skipped my usual chocolate - they offered Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Cheesecake and Dark Chocolate Raspberry Bread Pudding. I decided to try the Pumpkin Bread with Butter Rum Sauce and Cream Cheese Ice Cream.  The cake was light and tasty and the ice cream and sauce were excellent.\",\"I took my boyfriend to Casbah at the end of September for his birthday. We were seated near the door for our reservation however it was a very warm night so it was nice to sit in an open air setting. Our server, her name has slipped my mind, was excellent. I am not a fan of red wines but my boyfriend is and it being his birthday, of course I said let's get a bottle of red. We explained to our server what white varietals I enjoy and she suggested a bottle (which has also slipped my mind being months ago that we were there)that was perfect-both of us enjoyed it. We started off with the papardelle. The rabbit was delicious and it was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked-the flavors were amazing together! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the duck and I ordered the short rib ravioli. His words to describe the duck were \\\\\\\"life changing\\\\\\\". I was only able to taste a small piece of his since he ate it so quickly, but I agree it was excellent. The short rib was so tender and juicy. I was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not. It was the best ravioli I have eaten hands down! For dessert, we ordered a cheese tasting. It was the perfect way to end our meal-with the cheese tasting and a glass of wine. I can't wait to go back to Casbah and sample some other items-I would have ordered the entire menu on our first visit if I could have!\",\"I have a soft spot for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me to, and he made a special night out of it. We've been back many times, for many occasions, and Casbah has never disappointed. Great wine, cocktails, food, service, and atmosphere. It can be a little more cramped on the inside, but it's never too loud. If you can sit outside, it feels nice and spacious. It's also very nice downstairs.\\\\n\\\\nThe valet parking is a huge plus in my book, especially in that area of Shadyside. The service is always prompt and never overbearing. \\\\n\\\\nThe last time we went, we had the sheep's milk gnudi and I'm pretty sure it was sent straight from heaven down on to our plate. I nearly fought my fiance for the last piece. He loves me so he let me have it. The swordfish was wonderful. The lamb is always great. The short rib ravioli melts in your mouth. I'd highly recommend any of those.\\\\n\\\\nThe dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding is worth unbuttoning your pants for...and if you like dessert wines, you'll be in heaven for sure!\",\"I have to agree with the \\\\\\\"hit or miss\\\\\\\" reviewers about Casbah, at least when it comes to the food. I came here for brunch last weekend with a big group. They were very accomodating to us throughout the reservation process and the brunch, which was good. And our waiter, Daniel, was great. \\\\n\\\\nThe previous reviewer who said the Bloody Mary is the best drink was spot-on. It had a great spice and was the only drink that seemed like it had any alcohol in it at all. The mimosa and sangria were very \\\\\\\"eh.\\\\\\\" \\\\n\\\\nI loved my smoked salmon appetizer (and that did seem to be the hit at the table), but entrees around the table left people disappointed. The goat cheese and mushroom omelette could have had a heckuva lot more goat cheese and mushrooms, and my scallop/sausage/grits/egg dish just had way too much going on. The grits were actually fabulous, but the scallops were overcooked and got lost next to the scrambled eggs (?) and sage sausage crumbles. \\\\n\\\\nIf I lived in Pittsburgh, I could see myself coming back here for wine and appetizers, but I'm not sure I would make it a regular brunch or dinner spot.\",\"This update is for Casbah's brunch.\\\\n\\\\nAlright, Casbah. You got me, you got me good. Dinner as I mentioned before was decent, but the brunch, amazing. Compared to dinner, brunch at Casbah is definitely the better meal and deal. I don't advocate playing favorites when it comes to siblings in the same family, but sometimes you can't help it. Brother Brunch gets the nod here.\\\\n\\\\nBrunch is basically a fixed set. For $28, you choose an adult beverage (or non-alcoholic), an appetizer, and an entree. They start you off with some pistachio scones, buttermilk biscuits, and cornbread. Perfect, I like to stretch before I get my grub on. For my Prix-Fixe (fixed set), I went with the mimosa, smoked salmon, and sea scallop fry. \\\\n\\\\nSMOKED SALMON: If you like smoked salmon, then you would enjoy this appetizer. It's what you would expect but also a larger size than I thought it would be! \\\\\\\"Oh no, there's too much of something I like,\\\\\\\" said nobody ever. Upon seeing the smoked salmon display fanned out on its plate with bits of egg, red onion, and aioli garnished over top, my salivary glands couldn't control themselves! \\\\n\\\\nSEA SCALLOP FRY: You know I love me some scallops. The dish came with two scallops, a small croissant, small bits of fennel sausage, a side of white corn grits, and a little bit of butternut squash and caramelized onions. I was tempted to go with the classic eggs/toast/waffle as an entree, but I am so glad I put on my big boy foodie stretchy pants and took a chance. It's not your typical brunch dish and it's one I would definitely recommend. \\\\n\\\\nAll in all, fantastic brunch experience. Definitely felt comfortably full, but not in a self-hatred, \\\\\\\"I-regret-this-decision-immediately\\\\\\\" kind of way. Service was professional; our waitress kept the waters filled and came in to check on us a little after each dish was served.\",\"As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded ... the place is nice, fancy, organic-ish, alternating menu, nice atmosphere. Good date restaurant. Good food-lovers restaurant.\",\"Very disappointed in the customer service. We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. We will not be back . The iced tea is also terrible tasting.\",\"casbah is the last big burrito restaurant i had left to try and i really liked it. i started with the sangria to drink which was delicious, and i'm usually not a huge fan of sweet drinks like that. we split the grilled flatbread app. the dips weren't anything super special, but the bread was thick and flavorful. no complaints. then we both got piccola gusta and split all our items. (the piccola gusta gives you salad or soup, half a sandwich, and half a pasta) between the two of us we had the tomato & basil bisque, arugula salad, crab cake sandwich, salumi sandwich, orecchiette pasta, and ricotta cavatelli.\\\\ni'm not a big fan of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great as well. the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... probably my favorite part of the meal. both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.\\\\ni love the atmosphere, we sat out on the covered patio, and the service was great as well.\\\\ni'll definitely be back again, hopefully to try the different brunch and dinner menus!\",\"I'm actually giving it 3.5 stars.  3 for the appetizers and 4 for the entrees.  My wife and I went to Casbah for the first time.  As we usually do, we decided to share our entrees (TIP - you can get half portion sizes of the pastas!!) and augment the meal with a few appetizers.  For the appetizers, we got the chickpea flatbread, the arugula salad and the sea scallops.  The flatbread and salad were just OK.  The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the \\\\\\\"cured egg yolk\\\\\\\" which was infused in the avacado sauce.  For those who have never tried a cured egg yolk, I would consider yourself lucky.  Actually, the taste wasn't too bad.  The smell, however, reminded me of what you would smell if you were on the set of a nasty version of a Hoarders TV episode.  Must be an acquired taste.\\\\n\\\\nFor the main course, we chose the short rib ravioli and the cavatelli.  Both were excellent, especially the ravioli.  No complaints at all.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, a very pleasant experience.  Good atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly.  The place was busy and had a nice vibe to it.  Unfortunately, some of the food was a slight disappointment.\",\"Love Casbah.  Been going there for years and have never had a less than great meal and service.  OF course their signature lamb is to die for (with the Stag's Leap Petite Syrah).  What can I say -- the cheese plate is great.  Everything is well-prepared and the service is among the best in the -burgh.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"5_the_was_and\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"5_the_was_and\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[12.31037712097168,12.606310844421387,12.617574691772461,12.333783149719238,12.618749618530273,12.508417129516602,12.222508430480957,12.517693519592285,12.38538646697998,12.611823081970215,12.59981632232666,12.467300415039062,12.34274673461914,12.245479583740234,12.406909942626953,12.225436210632324,12.245224952697754,12.45018196105957,12.546686172485352,12.134617805480957,12.566378593444824,11.159788131713867,12.463044166564941,11.894848823547363,12.214760780334473,12.345465660095215,12.122091293334961,12.405349731445312,11.195106506347656,12.524686813354492,12.384064674377441,12.293200492858887,12.574506759643555,12.108907699584961,12.239737510681152,12.628316879272461,12.102031707763672,12.36535930633545,12.290721893310547,12.59384822845459,12.321730613708496],\"y\":[8.115989685058594,8.110603332519531,7.716057300567627,8.112323760986328,7.666411399841309,8.074075698852539,7.494025707244873,7.881967544555664,7.8907670974731445,7.703939914703369,8.135045051574707,7.888333320617676,8.055896759033203,8.028977394104004,8.121234893798828,7.770944118499756,7.970710754394531,7.867549896240234,8.23477554321289,7.858342170715332,8.132548332214355,8.480889320373535,8.116116523742676,7.886758327484131,7.507519245147705,8.166582107543945,7.922101020812988,8.106830596923828,8.57405948638916,7.768046855926514,8.023066520690918,8.100129127502441,7.668015956878662,7.923290729522705,7.854640483856201,7.693240165710449,7.8446364402771,8.03954029083252,8.12917423248291,7.712890625,7.958701133728027],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"As a Brooklyn based live indie-electronic/hiphop performer that travels, Shadow Lounge is by far one of my all time favorites.  As a Pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys, graff heads, MC's and DJ's doing their local thing, it's amazing to see this place has become so professional, original, and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of Pittsburgh.  The service is delightful on both sides (AVA/Shadow Lounge), the prices are just right, the sound system is a complete BANGER with crisp and clean sound.   The crowd is mad cool and always responsive to good music.  Shadow Lounge really holds it down for Pittsburgh's scenes no matter the genre.  Can't visit Pittsburgh without stopping by Shadow Lounge.\",\"Absolutely amazing! Great staff and service! Best music in Pittsburgh, hands down.  Good work guys!\",\"Not quite authentic but good enough for Pittsburgh. It's the only place that I've found that even comes close to a classic Chicago style deep dish.\\\\nI also had the french onion soup that wasn't bad. The croutons were still crunchy and it had just the right amount of cheese.\\\\n\\\\nMy girlfriend really enjoyed her Caesar salad and said she'd come back just for the salad.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I enjoyed it and would come back the next time I get a craving for a deep dish pizza. It wasn't authentic but it certainly was not terrible.\",\"When Hotlick's died, Buffalo blues was born. It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....\\\\n\\\\nFood is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! \\\\n\\\\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your \\\\\\\"space\\\\\\\" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called \\\\\\\"party room\\\\\\\" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\\\\n\\\\nWant to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"wonderful\\\\\\\" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, \\\\\\\"Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!\\\\\\\" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).\\\\n\\\\nThe food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!\\\\n\\\\nThis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!!\",\"If you want a true understanding of Pittsburgh in the morning, come here. This greasy spoon is always packed, and is one of the better of its kind south of the city.\\\\n\\\\nThey serve waffles in halves, which is great. The eggs and toast are good, the homemade hot sausage is excellent. The drawback are the barely cooked potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nIf you're hungry, get \\\\\\\"The Mixed Grill\\\\\\\"... Gab and Eat's brand of the \\\\\\\"kitchen sink\\\\\\\" breakfast that all Midwest places are about.\",\"I'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. I've only gone to Duke's one time, but the food was good. It wasn't too busy so our service was very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food at all.\\\\n\\\\nThe place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area. We sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full. The dining room area definitely fills up with an older, have lived in Pittsburgh all their lives crowd, while the younger crowd is in the bar area. \\\\n\\\\nI'll definitely be back since I live in the area.\",\"Wondering where the Pittsburgh hipster crowd hangs out? Look no further than the fixie parked outside the Quiet Storm. \\\\n\\\\nAnd then go inside and have some delicious food and drink.\",\"Though I didn't get a chance to visit this place when I visited last month, I really do love Quiet Storm and I will be sure I hit it up next time I'm in town visiting my friends there. The decor is adorable. The prices are reasonable. It was an intimate place to see a show and it's too bad they are no longer doing them here. I really feel like this place was one of the first things that made me heart Pittsburgh. It's truly a unique space.\",\"Ok this is my first yelp review, I never left any reviews for other restaurants, but I am writing it because I want others to know about this place more.\\\\n\\\\nRestaurant run by family. very friendly, clean cooking environment, and Great food. I would come to this place again and again whenever I visit Pittsburgh.\\\\n\\\\nIts less than 10min drive from Kennywood, if you are visiting Kennywood you should definitely try this place.\",\"Service is a little slow but overall the best food I've had in Pittsburgh so far. If you're a seafood fan, the scallops are amazing. Very decent wine list and lots of parking.\",\"This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \\\\\\\"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\\\\\\\" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.\",\"The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\\\\n\\\\nThe setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\\\\n\\\\nIt's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\\\\n\\\\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\\\\n\\\\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\\\\n\\\\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\\\\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.\\\\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \\\\\\\"Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\\\\\\\"  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\\\\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.\\\\n4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask \\\\\\\"would you like a refill on that?\\\\\\\" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \\\\\\\"would you like another one?\\\\\\\" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \\\\\\\"we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.\\\\\\\"  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.\",\"Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!\",\"This might be the best food I've had in Pittsburgh.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand. The hostess stand is located in the indoor space. We were seated in the outdoor section in a corner which was fairly drafty. This is the only negative point I have about the meal.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered the cheese  tasting menu, the duck, the scallop pasta, and the lemon sponge cake. Each bite was perfect -- flavorful and expertly cooked. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable. We left feeling full and happy.\",\"I miss this place. When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh, I remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did.\",\"Named for Pittsburgh greats, Gene Kelly and Billy Strayhorn, this historic theater is a real gem.  Originally the Regent, built in 1914, the building was renovated in 2000 as a performing arts center for theater, dance, music and film.  I have been to several fundraisers hosted by the Kelly Strayhorn, and they have always been first rate.  Also, I recently attended the Kelly Strayhorn's own fundraiser, Full Bloom, which was lots of fun.  As a venue, this place is definitely worth your attention, and the staff seems to bend over backward to make sure events go off without a hitch.\",\"OK, what is with all of these \\\\\\\"CASH ONLY\\\\\\\" places in Pittsburgh? I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. \\\\n\\\\nLooking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!\\\\n\\\\nMy first impression is \\\\\\\"Eh.\\\\\\\"  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast! Seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"2 eggs and toast $x.xx\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\\\"2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\\\\"2 eggs and pancake $x.xx\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI'd rather go to a Denny's and order the \\\\\\\"create your own Grand Slam!\\\\\\\"\",\"There is a disconnect here between this name, the decor and the food. That said, I had the best pork chop I've ever had here and for that I was endlessly thankful. Good salad, delicious bread and hummus. Great service. For Pittsburgh, top notch.\",\"The home-cooked breakfasts at The Rusty Nail in Bellevue are wonderful, prices are reasonable, the wait staff are gems, and is often bragged about by Bellevue locals.  That said, two stars is all I can muster primarily due to the tiny, cramped dining area.  I've witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.\\\\n\\\\nDon't get me wrong, I adore that Pittsburgh is a small, friendly city, but I'm not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs, nor knowing his guest gargled with Cool Mint Listerine this morning (or worse, didn't) .  Yes, the tables are packed THAT close together.  And whatever you do, don't dare bring a large friend here to dine when it's busy unless you enjoy feeling like a complete 'jag off' for doing so on the way out.\",\"Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh.\",\"My favorite for Pt. Breeze/Pittsburgh East End. Flat New York style, not greasy, timely delivery, they know my orders!\",\"The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The K\\\\u00f6lsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience.\",\"Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? Oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh.\",\"I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. \\\\n\\\\nThis place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\\\\\\\"  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.\\\\n\\\\nWe want to return sometime for \\\\\\\"turkey day.\\\\\\\"  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!\\\\n\\\\nCan't wait to return.\",\"The front serves as a good Pittsburgh sports bar. It's a particularly great place to watch the Penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. There are lots of HDTV's and there is a good selection of beer. \\\\n\\\\nThe food, however, is bland and is terrible bbq, even for the northeast. I would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home.\",\"The food here is pretty good.  Comparable to any 3 to 3.5 star restaurant.  The lamb is definitely good.  And it is definitely a good date restaurant.  I would rather give it 3.5 stars since I've definitely eaten at better restaurants. But for Pittsburgh, it ranks pretty high up.\",\"Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. \\\\n\\\\nIt's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. \\\\n\\\\nTuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.\\\\n\\\\nI'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.\",\"I really love this little place. The hot bar is almost always completely wonderful. I especially love the breakfast/brunch on weekends, it's one of my favorite meals. The potatoes and garbanzo bean patties are amazing.\\\\n\\\\nThe prices are pretty much in line with any smaller heath and local food oriented grocer. I can usually count on them to have specific items that Whole Foods is sold out of and sometimes at a better price. Plus, the Co-op hot bar is a million times better than the Whole Foods hot bar - quality over quantity all the way.\\\\n\\\\nShort lines, great staff, good for Pittsburgh.\",\"Very good cheap food. Pittsburgh classic.Great desserts! The oreo pie is amazing! The servers are always very friendly. The salad bar could be a little more clean.\",\"This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.\\\\n\\\\nIts been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \\\\n\\\\nThe food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.\\\\n\\\\n-Fish Sandwiich\\\\n-Salmon (huge and delicious)\\\\n-Flounder\\\\n-Shrimp a few ways (\\\\\\\"Norfolk\\\\\\\" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)\\\\n-Hawkins St Special\\\\n-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)\\\\n\\\\nThe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.\",\"Though Casbah has been around for ages this was our first time dining there. In short, the restaurant itself was nice and the food interesting though a little on the pricey side. Service started out great but for some reason our entrees took forever and our waiter more or less abandoned us. If I'm spending a $150 on dinner for 2 I expect some sort of explanation on why we are having to wait 45 minutes plus between our appetizer and the entrees. At a minimum, I don't want to have to flag down the server to order another drink and for god's sake don't make me ask for a refill of my water.  If I was only basing my decision on food I'd probably go back but all things considered there are too many other restaurants in Pittsburgh where I can get amazing food AND an amazing dining experience.\",\"In the Homestead area of Pittsburgh. Seafood gumbo was very good.\\\\nBroiled scallops were very good, partner had sea bass stuffed with lobster, also very good. Vegetable sides were not as good as the fish. With two glasses of wine the total was $83. In and out in an hour.\\\\nI'd go back because the fish was that good\",\"Don Don is a restaurant I find myself missing now and again, it's probably my favorite restaurant in Carnegie. Simple setup, just a small restaurant with a few tables and a TV. Oddly enough I think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup, never had better. The food is average but I always enjoyed eating there, great service and a cheap place to get Chinese food.\",\"One of the most eclectic venues in Pittsburgh. Shadow Lounge has a great variety of acts that it pulls in.\\\\n\\\\nI just went to their Titletown Soul & Funk Party and it was a really great time. Great music, fun crowd, pretty decent prices on drinks. I'll definitely be going back for Titletown and in general, Shadow Lounge is a great place to see alternative acts in Pittsburgh.\",\"1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!\\\\n2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta, not sure what.\\\\n3. Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!!\\\\n Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly!\",\"A great Pittsburgh diner with friendly service and good diner food. If there are any problems, the prices a bit high for diner food and, as others have said, it's extremely cramped. Otherwise, it's an enjoyable place to eat and the food is, indeed, very good.\",\"I like this place; it single-handedly made me hate Pittsburgh just a little less.  In fact, this would be an easy 5 stars if it wasn't in Pittsburgh and therefore emblazoned with all manner of Steelers propaganda, and as a Browns fan I...I just can't do it.  I'm sorry.  The sandwiches were good and prepared with genuine care and attention to detail, the people were friendly and the prices reasonable.

This location though has HORRIBLY SLOW service.  Seriously, we never wait less than 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, and we live near the Waterfront, so we've given this location the benefit of the doubt numerous times.  Each time hoping that the last was just a fluke, new staff, or something.  It's not.  Doesn't matter what time we go.  It seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes, and then the service is mediocre at best.  Occasionally, we've had a stellar service, but it's few and far between.

When we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back.

We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).

It sounds like a lot of food but the pasta serving is mini and it's a half sandwich.  For me, the size was just right.  The soup was awesome, and I could have eaten an entire lunch of just it.  The pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didn't have enough seasoning or spice.  I did love the addition of the cranberries in it though.  The perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream.  The roast turkey sandwich was just that.  Not out of this world, but not bad.  My biggest complaint was the service.  It took a really long time to get our meals which is always a bad thing during a weekday lunch.  \\\\n\\\\nI'd like to go back here for a happy hour when it's warm so I can enjoy the covered patio though and a nice glass of wine!\",\"Atmosphere and service was great.

Our waiter was great!!\",\"Recently dined here for the first time and can say that I was pleased with all of the food choices we had made at this establishment. The cold prickly pear soup was certainly a good choice of appetizer. The service was acceptable and the staff very welcoming. The only downside to this place is the atmosphere. It can get extremely loud at times (especially when you are sitting next to a party of 12) and it becomes rather difficult to have any table conversation.\",\"Just ate there, right next to GameStop & Google, has 3 small booths, & ordered the pepper steak w/ onion ($10.95). Food is fast fresh & hot, but mine had too much onion & not enough steak. At the end of the meal I was just eating onions with rice, though I hear this is healthy for you. Counter lady was cordial, but didn't reply when customers told her, \\\\\\\"Have a nice day\\\\\\\" #awkward. I know that English isn't her first language but she needs to catch on that people are wishing her well. Wasn't stuffed full either despite having eaten a large plate (I usually get this feeling eating Asian). This is basically a nice place to go for lunch that won't ruin your appetite for dinner.

The food is nothing special.  I guess what they have going for them is the beer.  Order the  Guacamole for the starter which was okay but for $8.50 and the portion was not worth it.

Very small menu (dinner). Was OK, but disappointing overall.\",\"Went there for lunch and had a decent meal.  While the Mongolian Beef was beyond excellent, the Moo Goo Gai Pan was average (although I did enjoy the shrimp in it).  Service was fine and decor is pleasant.  For some reason I'm just not in the mood to write a detailed review - please accept my apologies.\",\"It's not that delish.\",\"Love this place. I've never had anything that wasn't tasty here. They do fish and meat very well. It's not obscure molecular gastronomy style, but dishes we have had here were all well prepared and savory. We have been to several business dinners in their space downstairs, and it really is my favorite place for these - even more than the pricier steakhouses 'dahntahn.'\\\\n\\\\nWait staff were very attentive, and really made our experiences here great. Food was served efficiently for large groups, and arrived at the correct temperature. They have a great wine list, and overall offer a comfortable space with delicious food and drinks. Try the lamb loin, chicken, and cioppino - my three current favorites. Their pork chops are the specialty of the house, I'm told.\\\\n\\\\nWill definitely be back.\",\"Another really good meal here!  My friend and I went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean!  Gazpacho, pasta fagiole, homemade bread, eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite...the roasted veggie platter.  So much food we didn't think we would eat it, but it was so good we did!  They also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer air--great way to kick of summer!\",\"Hey do I really need to review this place? Look at the previous reviews but I will let you know that they have a great lunch deal, the piccolo gusto menu. I highly recommend it because it is a heck of a deal and you can have tastes of a few different items so it pairs well with my self diagnosis of A.D.D. no offense to anyone who has A.D.D but it definitely kept my attention throughout my lunch experience. First off the service was excellent very attentive server who was really a foodie, which I really appreciated. She knew a heck of a lot about the seemingly simple dishes I had ordered. The Piccolo Forno allows for a choice of Salad or soup, a pasta or risotto, half sandwich. I went with a taste of the Pea Tendrils and Frisee Salad, while slightly complex to eat, it had a savory flavor from the light dressing and blue cheese crumbles, then I went with cauliflower risotto which was riculous. That is how you make risotto people. For the half samich I went with the half turkey. The turkey wasn't just a normal turkey slice from the deli counter this was actually very nicely trimmed meat off of a bird that was prepared in house and it was immediately noticeable. All this for $15 dollars, I'll take it....And I'll do it again many times over again. Come here for lunch sometime and check it for yourself.\",\"Although I wouldn't  travel out of my way to have dinner here, this is a resturant that I enjoy having a meal at, when I am in the Homestead water front. On all of my visits here I have enjoyed the tempura shrimp. The dipping sauce are to die for.  I've found myself craveing the tempura shrimp, and the accompanying sauces. \\\\n\\\\nThe first time I ever had dinner here was as a birthday dinner with me and my big sister. So this resturant has sentimental value to me. I attach eating here to having a special night out in the Waterfront. \\\\n\\\\nBar Louie has some very flavorful and fun dishes for bar food, that is.\",\"Not Tasty At All.\",\"The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.\\\\n\\\\nWhat really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there...\",\"Walking into Jimmy Tsang's was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.\\\\n\\\\nHot & Sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.\\\\nWonton Soup was a very large portion and good.\\\\n\\\\nEgg Rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.\\\\nCheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.\\\\nChinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.\\\\nFlaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.\\\\n\\\\nTea tasted like American Lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.\\\\n\\\\nThe place was clean service was good, prices are very good, but the food was just average.\",\"Went for dinner Friday evening with friends and sat at the outdoor patio. It is so nice and relaxing there with the river and bike trail. The sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh. The Chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth, it was awesome. The Cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good. I had the carrot cake for dessert, it is big enough for 3 people. It was so delicious. My friend had the creme  br\\\\u00fbl\\\\u00e9e, which she said was very good. I was here 3 times this summer and every meal was excellent.\",\"My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around.\",\"Was very disappointed with the food. It was overcooked and not seasoned very well\",\"Service an atmosphere was great. I had the shrimp boil and it was very under-seasoned. Much closer to bland than anything.\",\"Very tasty food and drinks! Its a little pricey, but worth it if you want something better than a typical chain.\",\"Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.\",\"I have eaten some very good dinners here.

If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\\\\n\\\\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.\",\"To be honest, I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all.\",\"Good selection, but it will cost you.\\\\nMultiple fridges of cold beer, but only the cheap beer is cold.\\\\nNice in person, but rude on the phone.\\\\nParking lot, but none of the customers understand how to park.\\\\n\\\\nEvery good thing about this place is equaled with a bad thing about this place - hence it probably deserves 3 stars. I would really give it a 3.5 if available as this is currently my beer distributor of choice, but since its not possible I have to go with 4.\\\\n\\\\nWhy 4 you ask, when I just went through all that 3 star crap? Any place that offers beer samples provided by attractive women gets a half star boost for sure, and as long as I'm going there anyway it really makes for a more interesting trip.\\\\n\\\\nAfter all, if you don't like free beer, you are probably a terrorist.\",\"I hate this place.

The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\\\\n\\\\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \\\\n\\\\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\\\\n\\\\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.\",\"I rarely give a business a superior rating, but I have to say my wife and I had one of the best dining experiences at the Rock Bottom Brewery.

The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.\",\"I found Buffalo Blues to be merely OK.  I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small.  I actually liked the wing sauces I tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic).  Our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive.  \\\\n\\\\nI would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was OK.\\\\n\\\\nSurprisingly, lots of vegetarian options.  A vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.\",\"The absolute worst service I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt.  And, in looking at other reviews, I am not the first.  There are many options at the Waterfront, and I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place!\",\"This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout.\",\"Oh how the mighty have fallen. This place used to be good. Something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad. Since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable.\\\\n\\\\nWriting this review makes me sad because it is a great place to drink beer and watch the game. The beer is reasonably priced but the food is just expensive for what it is. I essentially live across the street so I know I'll go back, but I hope some of these poor reviews will help them turn things around in the kitchen.\",\"I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly.\",\"In the last week I've been here twice, partially because I don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty good! It's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.\\\\n\\\\nI tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than Sharp Edge's. The sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. To wash it down I had Loose Cannon beer, how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!\\\\n\\\\nOur waitress was a little slow, she said it was her first night. Who makes a new girl work on a Friday night! She seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because I wasn't hungry anymore so I didn't care.\\\\n\\\\nThe beer was pricy - Tuesday night I had a maker's sour for the same price as a pint of beer...\",\"Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \\\\\\\"OK\\\\\\\".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \\\\n\\\\nTheir food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.\\\\n\\\\nI feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens!\",\"Their food is okay and beer selection is diverse and good. \\\\n\\\\nThe problem i have with the place is that Buffalo Bills fans congregate here and cheer on every mediocre play their football team makes, (or almost makes) so it's like watching the Superbowl except it's a losing record team stopping a team on third down.\",\"Its not bad. I'm not into chain kind of places, but if you're with a group that doesn't do anything more adventurous, you'll do fine here. I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars but the house beer I had will make sure I come back from time to time.\",\"Good fun place to watch games while drinking and eating chicken wings or sandwiches.They have a good selection of wings and decent beer. I try different kinds of wings  every time  I go in but so far spicy garlic has been my favorite. This is a typical sports bar.\",\"Good place to watch a sports game.  Beer specials were good. Food is very overpriced though.  The wings are about the worst I've ever had... and I've had alot of wings growing up in Buffalo, NY.\",\"Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead is always a good time.  They brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  Saturday night C and I stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  \\\\n\\\\nOur first issue of the night was getting to Rock Bottom.  As the restaurant is located in Homestead, a trip across the Hi Level Bridge was in order.  Little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.  Upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task.  This place was absolutely packed due to several locations sharing a parking lot.  After we got inside, our wait was about 45 minutes but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.\\\\n\\\\nThe food at Rock Bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.  They also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.\\\\n\\\\nOur order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas and Ball Park Pretzels.  We had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. \\\\n\\\\nThe nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken.  Containing just the right amount of jalapenos they had a nice little kick as well.  In much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion.  With shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree.  The Ball Park Pretzels are the reason we come to this place.  They are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.\\\\n\\\\nAs far as the beers are concerned, I ordered up the sampler so that I could get a taste of the various brews.  They make a wide assortment of brews, from the Bud Lightesque \\\\\\\"Lumpy Dog\\\\\\\" to a dark \\\\\\\"Brew masters Choice.\\\\\\\"  I found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them.  I would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the Rock Bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack.  Don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but I would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.\\\\n\\\\nI give it 3 out of 5 Rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place.\",\"Wing night wednesdays! 50 cent price wings and $1 beer at William Penn on Tuesdays and my body is not hurting too badly the next day, Buffalo Blues for all you can eat wings. There are a ton of sauces to pair with these wings. They bring them out 5 at a time so plan on ordering your next selection when your wings come out because they take quite a bit of time to come. I don't think I have ever eaten the other food here except for the wings because they are pretty good. The only downside to this place is that service is really really slow.\",\"So, I went to Buffalo Blues tonight for the second time (not the second time tonight, the second time in my life) for dinner and some drinks, and to sum up my experience in a few words, both times it was about what I expected.  Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.\\\\n\\\\nI'll start with the drinks.  They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM).   Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.\\\\n\\\\nThe menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain.  One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.\\\\n\\\\nI know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars.  This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the \\\\\\\"word versions\\\\\\\" of the ratings that Yelp gives us.  \\\\\\\"A-OK,\\\\\\\" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.  The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.  It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.\\\\n\\\\nTo sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.  Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but \\\\\\\"just fine.\\\\\\\"  But I'm sure I'll go back there for happy hour again sometime.\",\"I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another \\\\\\\"brewery\\\\\\\" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp!\",\"I would take advantage of All you can eat wings on Wednesday. \\\\n\\\\nWe went on a regular oll Sunday night and even though the wings were tasty, my frugal self would've rather had AYCE. We tried a variety of sauces (we ordered 20 wings and every 5 can be a different flavor) The Buffalo Blues sauce was ok. It was just their signature bbq sauce. WE also tried garlic parm, honey teriyaki & gold rush. All were ok.\\\\n\\\\n The boozy buffalo is a good drink. It consist of smirnoff orange, tanquery, jose cuervo, captain, triple sec, OJ, fresh squeezed lemon and a splash of Coke. I seriously felt fabulous after one. It's served in a mason jar. ($12)\\\\n\\\\nLauren was a nice server even though the table in front of us put her through some bs-- they ate all of their food then complained to the server and asked for the manager complaining that what they got it wasn't what they ordered... no idea why they waited until every scrap of food was gone to complain but you know, you'll have that. kudos to Lauren for keeping a smile on her face.\",\"I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\\\\n\\\\nThey have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. \\\\n\\\\nIt is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. \\\\n\\\\nThe biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. \\\\nTheir fries are very good. And so are the wings.\\\\n\\\\nI'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.\",\"Food: 2 stars. It's really not very good. Especially the entirety of the combination platter they make with chicken fingers and wings. Blue cheese wasn't bad though. My wedge salad was enormous- more like a half head of lettuce than a wedge. Nice and fresh though. \\\\n\\\\nDrinks: 3 stars, for the decent variety (better than expected from a place like this) and the game time specials.\\\\n\\\\nService: 3 stars. Could have been better, could have been worse. Friendly but unattentive and not good at realizing when to come to the table. (Hint: if one person calls you over for a drink, make sure the rest of us are set before running away.) \\\\n\\\\nAtmosphere: 4 stars - really good job of having enough televisions for everyone to see the game/s and marking each so you know what's on. \\\\n\\\\n1 Bonus star for accommodating the Pittsburgh area Buffalo Bills fans! GO BILLS!!!\",\"Delicious wings - sometimes a bit too deep fried for my taste, but really tasty flavors and spices. We went for all-you-can-eat wings night but sadly I could barely finish my first dozen. Beer selection is much improved since  Turadg A.'s post; they have about 30 or so available to choose from.\",\"I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  \\\\n\\\\nI love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  \\\\n\\\\nHowever, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it's not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.\",\"The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews. Food was \\\\\\\"eh\\\\\\\", not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didn't text them back. This place has the potential to be great, but sadly, it falls way too short in almost all areas.\",\"I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \\\\n\\\\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \\\\n\\\\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \\\\n\\\\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss!\",\"Wednesday is Wing night, i.e., eat your face off night. For ~ $9 you can eat unlimited wings (with your choice of various sauces) for several hours. If you can, top it off with a brownie - they're quite good.\\\\n\\\\nI've mostly had the wings at Blues & I like all of the sauces, but the burgers are good, as well. Whatever you do, make sure to get the sweet potato fries & tip your waitress! (Especially if her name is Meg).\",\"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\\\\n\\\\nThey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\\\\n\\\\nThe food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entr\\\\u00e9e, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entr\\\\u00e9e salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.\\\\n\\\\nUpshot?  In the absence of a new sports bar opening up, we'll be back next season, but not before then.\",\"The best thing about Buffalo Blues revolves around Sundays during football season. For me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an NFL game...especially if you're not a Steelers fan. On any given Sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the NFL taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. Seating is the only issue. Get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. Luckily, the TV's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.\\\\n\\\\nThe draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by East End Brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, PBR), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.\\\\n\\\\nAs far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. I've had mostly great service at the bar, but I've also had average to below average service at tables. During bigger sporting events - primarily Steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I have to rate the food as average. I LOVE their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. Their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. The fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. I think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. The menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. It's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.\\\\n\\\\nIn the end, I'm giving Buffalo Blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a \\\\\\\"sports bar.\\\\\\\" As far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. They always get a good crowd for games (whether Sundays during the NFL season, Saturdays during big college games, or for Pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. There's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds I've experience in other sports bars in town. Most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in Shadyside for lunch and dinner.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"9_wings_the_beer\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"9_wings_the_beer\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[9.718464851379395,10.043374061584473,10.093655586242676,10.1378173828125,9.674392700195312,9.723608016967773,9.836710929870605,10.180707931518555,10.182474136352539,9.95715045928955,10.015887260437012,10.113527297973633,9.852720260620117,10.13689136505127,9.79456901550293,10.153428077697754,9.8034029006958,10.085027694702148,10.182415962219238,9.732452392578125,10.144891738891602,10.093755722045898,9.860535621643066,10.151885986328125,10.34058952331543,10.0734281539917,10.159379005432129,10.207651138305664,9.735078811645508,9.800819396972656,10.224128723144531,10.318492889404297,10.223291397094727,10.022806167602539],\"y\":[6.337429523468018,6.613676071166992,5.99650764465332,6.520240306854248,6.286073207855225,6.238442897796631,6.1902971267700195,6.615816593170166,6.5838212966918945,6.64626407623291,6.315384864807129,6.386465549468994,6.154006481170654,6.633988380432129,6.230563163757324,6.370567321777344,6.236906051635742,6.344890594482422,6.371087074279785,6.19938850402832,6.554441928863525,6.557369709014893,6.17718505859375,6.6264448165893555,6.085045337677002,6.953442096710205,6.586666107177734,6.326285362243652,6.237732887268066,6.242574214935303,6.651628017425537,6.179128646850586,6.320633888244629,6.386981964111328],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"There's nothing like a Saturday night filled with some good laughs, a few chuckles and a couple of good guffaws thrown in for good measure.  That's exactly what we enjoyed on Saturday night!\\\\n\\\\nWe hit the comedy club for an evening of Tammy Pescatelli - the hubby and I have enjoyed her routine on TV and on the occasional DVE morning show..  She didn't fail to give us a good evening of laughs!  The big surprise, was Gene Collier - yep, of the Post-Gazette sports writer fame - as the opener.  What a great opening act!  He cracked wise about the perils of being 58 and a baby boomer.  We could relate!\\\\n\\\\nThe sightlines were lacking.  There was a rather large woman at the table in front of us with massive Pittsburgh BIG HAIR.  All night long my own head bobbed from side to side as I attempted to actually watch the show, and not just listen to it, as she reached repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snacks.  \\\\n\\\\nWith a 2 drink minimum, my first drink was weak and the 2nd was quite strong!  All in all, the two balanced each other out.  But then, you don't go for the drinks, do you?  An enjoyable evening!\",\"What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road, because I could see myself being a regular here.\\\\n\\\\nHonestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  \\\\n\\\\nI am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time, I am bringing a big group of friends.\",\"The musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd, so I can't say they are all bad.  However the minimum for a song request is $5.  I spent $20 on a song for my girlfriend and they NEVER played it!!  They were playing songs for $5 and $10, but my $40 got me no where.  Even if they didn't know the song, which I doubt, they could have picked one they knew and improvised,  my tip, save your $$ on the requests.\\\\n\\\\nOtherwise it's fun for special events every once in awhile.\",\"Most definitely, I'm a fan of this joint. There are fabulous, high-quality displays of glass art, and they offer lots of learning opportunities if you want to make your own glass art or functional glass pieces. Plus, on gallery crawl nights (First Friday of every month!) they have snacks galore.\",\"My best friend took me to Sing Sing for my bachelor party. I had a blast. The musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. They also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected \\\\\\\"Rock Bottom\\\\\\\" restaurant for some grub. We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.\\\\n\\\\nThere were some drawbacks though. We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. But it's not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday, if their drinks weren't so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. Also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch. I'll probably be back, but only for a special occasion when I can afford it.\",\"i had fun here.. fun big kid games for me!!!\\\\nO..

I've never actually paid full price for a ticket here. \\\\n\\\\nThe two-item minimum is bit bothersome to me though...I don't mind the requirement so much, but the quality isn't good and the prices are high. Our four items total came to about $30 (two appetizers and two beers) and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the servers aren't even very friendly. Also beware...they have a lot of rules here. They won't seat till the whole party is there; if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party HAS to order dinner, automatic gratuity added to the check, etc. etc.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"box office\\\\\\\" is also weird...you get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slide-under slot...then you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there, so I don't get the whole hoopla with the window.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all though, the seats are comfy enough, the atmosphere is pretty nice, and the acts are good.\",\"Had a great time at Sing Sing a while ago with friends.  Friendly staff.  Will return.\",\"i was here for a concert the other night. apparently, there's much more to the venue than the side we were on where the stage was, but it was a pretty small area for a pretty big crowd. ok, so we arrived shortly before the opening act and ordered beers. $4 for a yuengling bottle isn't ideal, but whatever. we snagged a table with stools near the door before too many people got there. by the time the opener was over, the place was packed shoulder to shoulder, and whether we stood or remained on our stools, it was nearly impossible to see the stage.\\\\ni liked that it was an intimate venue, but that many people packed into such a small space, with expensive drinks, and not even a good view? not the best venue i've ever been to...\",\"Eh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a Saturday night.\\\\n\\\\nBobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait.\",\"Pretty fun place to go every once in a while, but, believe me, by the end of the night you'll be ready to go. The show lasts around 5 hours, by the 3 hour mark you'll be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your $9 a pop drinks listening to the same dirty jokes over and over and over again.\",\"In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me.\\\\n\\\\nThe 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the Rock Bottom brews they serve.\",\"I'm HUGE SNL fan, so naturally if someone who's been in the cast is touring, I'll come here to see them. Some have been really great...Jim Breuer. Some have been (surprisingly) very bad....Tracy Morgan. But it's always been a pleasant experience at the venue.  There's not a bad seat in the house and it's small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage.  Beware if you sit in the very front, you KNOW what's going to happen!\\\\n\\\\nA couple downsides.... \\\\n\\\\nWaiting outside in a line in the dead of winter.  The lobby is so small you're forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show let's out.  And if you want a good seat, you may be waiting in line for a while.  BURR!\\\\n\\\\nThe two drink minimum. I kinda get why they do it, to make money, of course. But this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks. Better to stick with beer and wine at these places. No frou frou drinks for me! \\\\n\\\\nAlso, as to be expected, the food's not that great. In a perfect foodie world, places that served food would make it fantastic! Since that's not going to happen, you just go into those places hoping for the best. I've never had anything great here. Nacho platter too many re fried beans, to little nacho's....annnnnd I'm out! \\\\n\\\\nSo what did we learn here? Good venue, stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand. The talent is really what you're there for so, enjoy the show!\",\"Went there last night with 8 peeople. There was another 14 people party.\\\\n\\\\nThe food was good -- not great but good. We waited 45 minutes for the first dish to arrive and that only because we sent one of our folk to see what was going on. \\\\n\\\\nThey did bring drinks and tea promptly.\",\"I went to a yelp event here, where we were able to make a fused glass piece and also watch some demonstrations and go to the gallery. Everything in the gallery was amazing. The demonstrations were neat, and the fused glass was something I would go back to do again.\\\\n\\\\nI really didn't know that the glass center was open most of the time, and if you go there on any random day, you can watch whatever is going on. I think that is pretty cool! They also have classes where you can blow glass or make beads or whatever you want... I can't wait to pick up my piece and come back for another class!\",\"I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations, which was good because it was packed that Saturday night. The performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, \\\\\\\"you bitch, you slut, you whore\\\\\\\" and  \\\\\\\"twinkle twinkle little slut, why don't you take it up the butt\\\\\\\" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. Or maybe not.\",\"Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! :) Great humor too!! :)\",\"It's surprising how long it took me to get here, then I hear a rumor they're moving soon anyway! Geez... way to be behind the times Rachel!\\\\n\\\\nI've been interested in a bunch of the nights they've hosted before, but have never made way way over. I went to celebrate one Miss Aja J's birthday for Hip Hop vs House night. I'm a big hip hop fan, but not much into house. They had two dueling DJ's and an MC hosting the event. I actually liked the mash up of the two genre's. It was definitely better than just house.\\\\n\\\\nThey have about 5 beers on tap, which I think is impressive for a \\\\\\\"club.\\\\\\\" Especially different since it was much more than Miller Light. They actually had a Pumpkin brew on tap, which forgive me for not remember, I was into! At $5.50 it wasn't breaking the bank, but it wasn't a $3 Miller Light fo sho! \\\\n\\\\nWe came a little early, but it seemed like the night really started to pick up around 11pm. Yep, I'm old, I left at 11pm. Lame, I know! \\\\n\\\\nI hope they find a new home, because I think it's a place we don't have anywhere else and I'm happy to have been finally!\",\"This was my second visit to the club and it was still a blast. My girlfriends bought tickets for John Witherspoon for my bachelorette. We were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious! He was wonderful. \\\\n\\\\nThe servers were fantastic. They always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink. I suggest the Pink Cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. \\\\n\\\\nThe only reason it isn't 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm. They came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldn't be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm. It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building, order drinks then the show finally started at 9:45pm.  The host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late.\",\"He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls.\",\"I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!  My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren't cheap (around $10-12).  However, I would definitely go back sometime!\",\"This place has gone significantly down hill.  I've gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.\",\"Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. \\\\n\\\\nShut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. \\\\n\\\\nMy big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.\",\"My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \\\\n\\\\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? \\\\n\\\\nIn addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. \\\\n\\\\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. \\\\n\\\\nThe Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.\",\"Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet \\\\\\\"waterfront\\\\\\\" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.\\\\n\\\\nWhen it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.\\\\n\\\\nBut today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song you're the piano man has run it's course. I don't hate Sing Sing, but I could never come here more than once a year. It's a been there, done that kind of place.\",\"My girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last Saturday. I highly suggest that you make reservations because we were able to just walk right in and sit down. There were people there waiting 30 minutes+. We had the sangria which was amazing. Our sever Alex recommend it and it was perfect for the 4 of us.  I had their thin crust pepperoni pizza which really hit the spot. My two friend had salads which they said were amazing and my other friend joined me in ordering a pesto chicken pizza. Let's just say there wasn't any food left on the table when we were finished.  I will be back for sure.\",\"Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend Rock Bottom. Couldn't be happier!\",\"There were zero other people here aside from my friend and I.\",\"Good club for a good laugh. High food prices (most comedy clubs are), 2 item min. The food was less than stellar.

My sandwich came with a boring pasta salad and some tortilla chips out of a bag.  Otherwise the atmosphere was fun, and the wifi was free if you ask for the password.\",\"My experience has been ok at the Quiet Storm because I have 1) not deviated much from my usual menu choice (Original Home Fries = delicious) and 2) I have often known several members of the wait staff at any given time.\\\\n\\\\nThis has given me reason to continue eating at Quiet Storm on occasion.\\\\n\\\\nNegatives... I have eaten with several others over the years who have been wholly dissatisfied with their meals (small portions, not enough seasonings, could taste baking soda flavor in baked goods, etc). Service can be a little slow at times. And I have been burned a few times when going out of my way (it is a little off the beaten path for many) to score some delicious Home Fries only to find that the QS had inexplicably closed early.\\\\n\\\\nDespite this, FOR PITTSBURGH, the QS is a good spot for vegan/vegetarian fare.\",\"They have these tofu tenders, which are akin to a vegan buffalo wing.  I can't put my finger on it, as there really doesn't appear to be much to them in terms of some sort of secret cooking technique, but holy crap, I can't get enough of them!

I was in love with the pierogidilla and happy to leave the table feeling full without having any meat.\\\\n\\\\nI wrote a review of Quiet Storm on my web site, Binge! http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/07/07/ive-got-an-itch-for-kitsch-quiet-storm-in-bloomfield/\",\"Quiet Storm is a delicious and cozy little place located in the colorful Bloomfield area. The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! \\\\n\\\\nI've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan \\\\\\\"cheese\\\\\\\" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. \\\\n\\\\nThe second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. \\\\n\\\\nQuiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) \\\\n\\\\nTip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. \\\\n\\\\nYou may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water.\",\"Food is tasty, though portions are for the waifish hipster types. Location is inconvenient and I would not recommend people walking by themselves at night on that stretch of Penn. Service is very uneven i.e. bad, even when the place is practically dead. I can't really speak on the coffee, though they do have good tissanes(however getting them to refill your hot water is another thing).\\\\n\\\\n**************\\\\nOkay I won't change my rating, but I take back what I said about the food. They have changed the menu and it is really bad. \\\\n\\\\nWe had Buffalo Tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry. \\\\n\\\\nI had the Thai Peanut Tofu Wrap which tasted just like peanut butter. \\\\n\\\\nI don't understand the point of Mockamole? It's made with peas instead of avocado. \\\\n\\\\nHow to describe the food... it's as if they took pictures of how food should look and made the food without thinking about how food should taste. Gee peas are green, just like avocados?? \\\\n\\\\nI would go there for coffee/tea or whatever to hang out, but not for the food. \\\\n\\\\nOkay there was one decent thing on the menu which was the artichoke dip. I was completely disappointed.\",\"So I admit my boyfriend and I actually didn't know it was vegetarian/vegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely.\\\\n \\\\nWe went this past weekend and had brunch. We each had thai coffee which was ok, not stupendous, not horrible. He ordered the veggie burger, and I had the chocolate oatmeal pancakes.\\\\n\\\\nHis burger was unseasoned and fairly cold, my pancakes were okay...but to be honest really lacked flavor (the taste of what I imagine cardboard to be came to mind). I don't discriminate, I'm all for veggies and vegan food, but just because those are your ingredients doesn't mean you can't cook things well and add seasoning.\\\\n\\\\nI am intrigued to go back because the apple cheese panini sounded possibly better than what we had.  \\\\n\\\\nI will note that ourwaitress was very sweet and friendly, but the food was just lacking in flavor so much that it's really deterred us from going back.\",\"I'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. It just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd.\\\\n\\\\nA small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But \\\\\\\"Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings\\\\\\\" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their \\\\\\\"chorizo\\\\\\\" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed \\\\\\\"foods.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nLess processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, \\\\\\\"Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat\\\\\\\"? I have! But don't expect that feeling here. It will be more like: \\\\\\\"Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nTwo stars because I really like the drinks here. The ones I remember trying were the ginger lemonade, the Mexican hot chocolate, and the root beer with a shot of espresso. They have some really wonderful sounding tea options that I wish I could try, but I generally avoid this place because of the food.\",\"I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep finding myself hungrily returning to the Quiet Storm. The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the \\\\\\\"8th Ward\\\\\\\" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as \\\\\\\"garlicky\\\\\\\" on the menu. Sooo wrong. \\\\\\\"The Butter,\\\\\\\" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.\\\\n\\\\nAt this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. \\\\n\\\\nI wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction. And it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary (I shutter at even calling it that) mediocrity of \\\\\\\"the best\\\\\\\" vegetarian restaurant Pittsburgh has to offer.\",\"This place is a train wreck. Quiet? No. Storm? Yes. Loud, slow, bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that I have.\\\\n \\\\n1. The Vegan / Hipster / Metal thing has got to go. All I kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the Mot\\\\u00f6rhead tank top. I am a huge Mot\\\\u00f6rhead fan, but when I go to an overpriced restaurant I don't want Lemmy to be making my food.\\\\n \\\\n2. The food is bland. Shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100% vegan.\\\\n \\\\n3. The service was pretty bad. Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.\\\\n \\\\n4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.\\\\n \\\\nI have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and Quiet Storm does not even come close to the top 10. I think Pittsburgh deserves better.\",\"Delicious!! Not a vegetarian, but this place might convince me to switch over. Had a few breakfast options and was blown away by the Greek plate and the QTF. Excellent coffee too.\",\"I've been back to Quiet Storm many times. I can accept the hit or miss service since it's pretty cheap and casual. That's not really an excuse for bad service, it only somehow softens the blow, but why be mediocre? \\\\n\\\\nThe environment is comfortable (unless you sense the servers don't want you there). The music ranges and is appropriate for the environment. It's never too loud or aggressive. Free wi-fi helps and the milkshakes are slammin! The food is inconsistent, but often good. The Black-a-dilla is my favorite. \\\\n\\\\nI really want to like Quiet Storm, but it only merits 2 stars. Their food, service, and hours are inconsistent. It seems they often close early. \\\\n\\\\nOwners, please stick to your business hours. It's not like you're open that late to begin with! Perhaps everybody wants to go home, I don't blame them for that, and you may have run out of a few things, but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away.  \\\\n\\\\nOR, If you believe this is an acceptable business practice, it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to '9am - until we feel like it.'  This way there are no set expectations and we can't really begrudge you for it. \\\\n\\\\n...My vote is to just stick with the hours you created.\\\\n\\\\nThanks!\",\"I love quiet storm! I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. The country burrito is BOMB! So good, there has to be crack in the gravy. I also enjoy the tahini queso, I often add it to my burrito. It's best on the nachos. For around $13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast/brunch coffee/tea included. They also have great pastries & dairy free coffee drinks & milkshakes! It's a vegan dream come true. It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait, but completely worth it. The atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (Garfield) which also means they often play good music! Last time I was there it was all Neil Young! Accompanied my burrito perfectly! I definitely recommend this place to vegans & NON-vegans alike!\",\"Remember the days of bands in the back at night, and interesting kids hanging out at the bar all day? Well, the bands were the first to go, followed quickly by the comfy sofas. The kids didn't take long to leave, and now, years later, faced with a frankly less-than-appetizing Saturday menu, I find that the ability to substitute something else for the increasing amounts of potato filler is gone, too.\\\\n\\\\nQuiet Storm used to be a straight five star. My last experience was honestly two-star, but nostalgia and history don't allow me to give it less than a three.\\\\n\\\\nI'm sure all the changes over the years have been in the name of efficiency, but they've come at expense to the clientele. Here's hoping Quiet Storm rediscovers the mojo (and the menu) that once made them great.\",\"I don't think I would have known about Quiet Storm if it hadn't popped up several times in friends' Yelp feeds in the last couple years.  I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  \\\\n\\\\nHusband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\\\\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\\\\u00e9.  Both were excellent.\\\\n\\\\nFor my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.\\\\n\\\\nAnd that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.  When really, I'd been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables, plain grains and humble legumes.  Still, I won't discourage you from eating here.  I just might come back myself.\",\"My friend and I were having a weekend trip to Pittsburgh (first time!) and stopped in for brunch on Sunday before our visit to the nearby Pittsburgh Glass Center. We weren't familiar with the area & this looked like a cute place- ended up definitely enjoying our time here!\\\\n\\\\nWe weren't aware that it was a vegan place; regardless, the drinks menu & and the brunch menu both looked amazing. Friend ordered the Nyam, which she said was very filling (surprisingly). I had the the Country burrito, which definitely surpassed my expectations. Decent, good. \\\\n\\\\nFriend & I both ordered the Don Juan mocktail which was the highlight of the meal- holy crap! AMAZINGLY GOOD- I always think that horchata tastes a little too watery but the coconut juice & caramel helps round out the drink & make my tastebuds sing. I'm only sad that I can't keep visiting and trying more of their drinks. \\\\n\\\\nMight not necessarily go out of my way to come back BUT I would definitely go again if I were in the area. :)\",\"I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?\\\\n\\\\nThe Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.\\\\n\\\\nAND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early.\",\"Yes, I know.  I'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.\\\\n\\\\nBut let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to \\\\\\\"look in the back\\\\\\\" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\\\\n\\\\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.\\\\n\\\\nNeedless to say, I will not be coming back to this place.\",\"Quiet Storm occupies a special place in my heart compartment because, one lazy Sunday in 2004, I discovered Alfred Bester's The Demolished Man. Imagine my joy: a cyberpunk fan, finding a tattered copy of some anonymous-looking book in some proto-hipster cafe (this was back before it was toooo hipster), and discovering the glories of Alfred Bester. (Seriously, The Demolished Man is good.) It also fit in perfectly with the blue collar/gentrified charm of Pittsburgh in general, and the Hill District/Lawrenceville/Bloomfield in particular.\\\\n\\\\nAnyway. I have returned now in 2011 for a veg brunch, and it was a pleasant, if not-so-good-value-for-money experience. I got the True Grits (yeah, Jeff Bridges, yeah), which was a HUGE bowl of grits (some shaved, grocery store-feeling cheddar on top), a pile of delicious, chopped lemony kale, some pretty blah scrambled eggs and a large glass of cranberry juice (very healthy!). Overall, it was fine. I didn't like the $12 price tag so much (seriously, grits is pioneer food and you're charging me $12!), nor did I dig the shades of hipper-than-thou among the clientele, but shrug shrug.\",\"I'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years. Every time I have ever gone, the service is awful. It's as if they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. I think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw. Also, the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine. the one great thing about this place is their coffee, and that's it.\",\"I was somewhat worried about going here since the reviews seem to be bimodal, so I was pleasantly surprised when our food was flavorful (some reviewers complained of blandness) and not trying to imitate meat (some reviewers said that seemed to be the goal), but exploiting the wonderfulness of vegetables and scrambled tofu (which, despite the other complaints, was just fine). We had the \\\\\\\"tenders\\\\\\\" appetizer, with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce, but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan, you would like that too. We all thought it was wonderful. On the advice of the server, I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy, heavily peanut-flavored, but full of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili, that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!), but the apple panini (with \\\\\\\"seisage\\\\\\\", cheese, etc.) was very good. Finally, Panchu had the coconut burrito, which was huge, but he ate the whole thing, and was very happy. We all split a vegan cinnamon roll for dessert, and I really wish I had been able to get my own!\\\\n\\\\nSome complained about the wait; I think this place fits well with the \\\\\\\"slow food movement.\\\\\\\" If you want fast food, go to McDonald's.\\\\n\\\\nSo, based on one observation, I gave it five stars. YMMV.\",\"Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!\",\"Me and my kids got food togo from here, because it came recommended from someone at the local food co-op as a place with good vegan options.\\\\n\\\\nCute and attractive DIY style decor.\\\\nFriendly staff.\\\\n\\\\nI really liked the food quite a lot (i'de give it 4/5 stars).  GOt a tofu banh mi with a side salad.  When I asked what dressing they had, I expected to hear the list of \\\\\\\"usual\\\\\\\" uninspiring dressings that vev/non-veg restaurants often have.  The first one she mentioned was a green chili dressing tasted as fun and yummy as it sounded.\\\\n\\\\nMy kids didn't really love their vegan homefries meal (with scrambled tofu and a weird vegan cheese sauce thang).\\\\n\\\\nAnyhoo.  Really pleasantly surprised with this joint, and the food was pretty reasonably priced.  \\\\n\\\\nAs with any place I review, I am subtracting a star because they aren't all veg.  Anyplace selling eggs dairy and flesh isn't perfect for me.  I'de probably really call this 3.5 stars.\",\"Honestly, this the last place you'd ever expect to see me. First it's a vegan/veggie cafe, I am a complete carnivore. Secondly, it's like hipster brunch paradise, I'm super preppy (a heavily tattoed preppy person but still).  Yet this was one of the only places open on Labor Day and I walked in with my vegan friend, she immediately recognized her people and practically jizzed in her pants over the menu. OMG seitan gravy and cheez?\\\\n\\\\nWTF is seitan gravy and cheez? Why does she keep calling vegan cheese, \\\\\\\"cheez\\\\\\\" anyway? I decided to go with the flow and order the Home Fries Ranchero. Basically their \\\\\\\"famous\\\\\\\" home fries, chili, sour cream, eggs or tofu and cheez. I went native and ordered tofu vs eggs, and you know what? I liked it. It came out in a big heaping pile on a 70s retro plastic plate, accompanied with some awesome coffee. My friend had hummus and pita, cause not only is she vegan she only eats things in the white/beige color range (food racist).\\\\n\\\\nOne bad thing, the bathroom has no door, only the stall does. Basically it's a unisex bathroom where all the delightful sounds and smells can be experienced by diners directly in front of you. For a place that serves chili and \\\\\\\"cheez\\\\\\\" they may want to reconsider this open approach.\\\\n\\\\nThere are some previous reviews about arrogant hipsters/bad service etc. I have say our waitress was awesome and attentive. My coffee was filled routinely, she understood that requesting a \\\\\\\"buttload\\\\\\\" of cream meant a larger carafe of cream rather than a thimble. The host was apologetic for making us wait for more than a few minutes to sit down.I do admit it does have the indie coffee house feel, and yes hipsters abound here, but I have a feeling these are some legit hipsters. Not the trust fund having, whiny, I drink PBR, and annoy people with my smugness style hipster.  I bet these hipsters been squezzing their junk into tight pants long before I was born. I don't know, I just get that impression. \\\\n\\\\nI however feel a little weird for writing such a positive review on a uber crunchy place, so I feel the need to go slash tires on someone's Prius now.\",\"This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \\\\\\\"chicken maputo\\\\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\\\\\\\".  Does the average diner know what \\\\\\\"maputo\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"piri piri\\\\\\\" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\\\\n\\\\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.\",\"I didn't realize that Quiet Storm was a completely vegetarian restaurant until I noticed the word \\\\\\\"seitan\\\\\\\" printed after every meat item on the menu. Normally I'd find this annoying, as I'm an unabashed and unapologetic meat eater. That doesn't mean I don't love a good veggie dish, but fake meat masquerading as real meat is one of my pet peeves. If you're going to serve vegetarian food, don't try to pretend it's anything else.\\\\n\\\\nThat grievance having been aired, I ordered the Blackadilla, a quesadilla boasting no false meat items, but stuffed with black beans, basmati rice, sweet potatoes, pineapple and cheddar cheese. It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. \\\\n\\\\nThe menu at Quiet Storm is large, with breakfast and lunch/dinner items as well as an array of cafe drinks and desserts. In spite of the prevalence of seitan and tofu, there are a number of dishes that I look forward to sampling upon return.\\\\n\\\\nAnd I do plan to return. As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating.\\\\n\\\\nThe one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either. It has to be a pre-determined destination rather than a drop in for random passersby. But that might just be OK.\",\"Quiet Storm is, perhaps, the most expensive vegetarian diner I have ever been to, even by big city standards! Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.\\\\n\\\\nF.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing. It was quite good that way and I might recommend that QS rethink the Gyro presentation if they want to continue using so much lettuce.\",\"Daniel Fast friendly restaurant with good food. Stopped for an early supper before Saturday night church service after searching Yelp for vegan restaurant options. Food was good, service was good, price was very reasonable.

My wife and I are moving to North Carolina in two days, and Tasty Chinese was the thing about Pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most.  These are great folks, and I wish them the best of success in the future.  Remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!

Before I continue, I will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(As was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(I assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  However, I will chalk some of it up to my mistake because I thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. So, Tasty, you get a pass on the rice\\\\n\\\\nAnyhow, I ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(I've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). I ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. Also, the tofu was in very large chunks, which has seemed to be my luck lately. I want surface area, and I don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. I will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.\\\\n\\\\nThe eggroll, as I said, was tough.. It tasted good, but it was tough, and small... This probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum I do need to order something else with my tofu... I hope the soup is good.\\\\n\\\\nThe lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when I ordered. Portion size was good, for the $10.44 it cost me, I'll definitely be able to make a lunch out of what is left.\",\"The pros:\\\\nYou get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS. \\\\nThey have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe cons:\\\\nThe woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. \\\\nMy pork dumplings were \\\\\\\"fried\\\\\\\" only on one side and were raw in the middle. \\\\nEverything was pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. \\\\nLeftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! \\\\n\\\\nIf you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout.\",\"Yep, closed!  My dad and I were gonna come here dinner last night.  He called me and told me to meet him at China Palace instead.  \\\\n\\\\nSo long Jummy Tsang's!  You were one of the last of the old time Chinese joints.\",\"This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. \\\\n\\\\nThey were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this is an \\\\\\\"Asian Bistro.\\\\\\\"\",\"This is an average Chinese buffet. The food was not bad, but not impressive neither, plus some cheap American food. The food was a little too greasy even by American Chinese food standard, and my stomach complained soon after I left that place. To me, that's a no-go signal.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps the food would be better there.\",\"I'm not a mean reviewer, if you look at the other places I've reviewed, but this was just so so so disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin was very poorly done. The meat was extremely bland, with very little seasoning. I have a very low sodium tolerance and yet I still found this fish to be made too bland. The rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as I took my first bite. I talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. It wasn't the same. The whole dish was a fail and I don't think I am ever coming back again :(\",\"Food: There are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores, but the food is only so-so.  We've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  The general Tso's tofu and the Moo Shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  The eggplant was soggy and not great.  The portions are large.  Nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.\\\\n\\\\nPrice: Tasty is cheap.  \\\\n\\\\nDrinks: N/A\\\\n\\\\nAtmosphere: Typical Chinese takeout place.  A photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  Located in the plaza next to Pizza Parma.  Decent location for that end of Shadyside.\\\\n\\\\nService: The employees speak poor English but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  The food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly\\\\n\\\\n(-): food is nothing to write home about\\\\n\\\\nWould I go back again? If I'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else.\",\"Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.\\\\n\\\\nSo... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\\\\n\\\\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \\\\\\\"pork\\\\\\\"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\\\\n\\\\nNext came my \\\\\\\"lunch-portion\\\\\\\" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \\\\n\\\\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. \\\\n\\\\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\\\\n\\\\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\\\\n\\\\nI've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \\\\\\\"lunch-portion\\\\\\\" cost was $9.95.\\\\n\\\\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\\\\n\\\\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.\",\"Jimmy Tsang's Chinese Restaurant is one of the old \\\\\\\"traditional\\\\\\\" Pittsburgh restaurants, a place you remember as always \\\\\\\"being there.\\\\\\\"  My parents feel the same way about it.  It is a good, if unspectacular place with reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, Chinese flank steak, and authentic eggrolls.  \\\\n\\\\nI don't normally go for the spicy fare, indeed I prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables, but they have one item on the menu that I've always wanted to try--Sau La Gi, which is stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts.  Perhaps I've never noticed, but I don't recall seeing it anywhere else.  It was good, but Hoo-Boy did I have to pace myself while eating it.  And have plenty of water nearby!  Sau La Gi was worth trying once, but it really wasn't to my tastes and I doubt I'll have it again.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend Maryann tried  Ching Za Gai (spicy also) which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce.  I sampled it and perhaps I will order that for myself next time.  I'd like to cook a milder version of it myself at home.  \\\\n\\\\nMore to my tastes however are the Garden Chicken, Chicken with Broccoli, or Beef with Pea Pods.  Seafood dishes include Sweet and Sour Shrimp and  Sauteed Shrimp Szechaun Style.  Yeah, I'm a little unimaginative when it comes to Chinese food, but I know what I like and if a place can do the basics right, it's okay in my book!\\\\n\\\\nJimmy Tsang's also has a convenient and inexpensive lunch menu.  The place also does Korean Barbecue and you can book a private dining room for you and your special someone with a $100 deposit.\",\"This is the fourth Changs I've eat ate. It was pretty good. The food was kinda like it had been previously frozen. Had a strange texture. Some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken. Overall still pretty good. Would eat at this one again.\",\"The food here is good but it is not exceptional. \\\\n\\\\n I've been to this restaurant occasionally for a couple years and the menu hasn't changed at all. There is the typical Asian fare such as General Tso's, fried rice, noodles, stuffed shrimp and dumplings. There is also American macaroni and cheese, home fries and ham. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I go to China Garden, I always request a carry out container as I find it nauseating to sit in the dining area and see other patrons pile their plates with astonishing heaps of food. One thing for sure is that China Garden gets plenty of customers.\\\\n\\\\nDefinitely come here for a reasonably priced buffet!\",\"We visitied PF Changs on Sunday with a large group of 20 people.  Although they had to split the tables - everything was delicious!\\\\n\\\\nWe enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wraps...to the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the guests...to the fried banana dessert!\\\\n\\\\nif you are with a group, and you want dessert - get the fried bananas!  They come wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and with coconut/pineapple ice cream.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, we had a great time and would come back here again.\",\"Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?\",\"This place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall Chinese restaurant. There's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out and the service is rude. I decided to give Tasty a try because it's conveniently located on Highland Avenue and has easy parking.\\\\n\\\\nI ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Crab Rangoon. Sadly, they prepared Kung Pao Beef instead. It's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. It's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. While it wasn't what I ordered, the food was good...but there is better Chinese food out there.\",\"3/6/12  visit -  i am from san francisco bay area and if u want a dive go to china town in san francisco. - this place was dirty like chinatown dive but some of the best food i have every tasted came from a dive. the food was really good and my group ordered a bunch of different things it was all good- a- taste.- prices are reasonable a-. --------they dont speak english very good and got my order wrong.\\\\nsweet potatoe fries a+\\\\npizza  - a\\\\neggplant hoagie b+\\\\ngreek salad b+\\\\ngyro a+\\\\nif they scrubbed the place down and the lady spoke better english 4 star ****\",\"Far away from real Chinese food. Doesn't even taste good as American style Chinese food.\",\"So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. \\\\n\\\\nWe came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food.\",\"I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. \\\\n\\\\nThe last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \\\\n\\\\nAs for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \\\\n\\\\nThe workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking.\",\"Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.\",\"The worse \\\\\\\"Chinese food\\\\\\\", even the white rice which came with the ogle sweet and sour chicken is really bad.  Please don't eat this food.\",\"Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff, with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat.  You will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish, but it is delicious.\",\"I was unimpressed with my food and I am even more sad to see, now that P.F Chang's mass produces frozen dinners. \\\\nThis is about as far away from Chinese food you can get, unless of course you are eating microwaved warmed shrimp fried rice. The restaurant is cluttered and the music was up so loud.  I had to yell to carry on a conversation. P.F Chang's in the Waterfront is a unmemorable experience. Maybe I would have better luck microwaving my own meal at home?\",\"I've had PF Changs both in Pgh and KC and honestly, I'm never been disappointed nor elated with the food. It's 'upscale' Ameri-Chinese food. You don't come here seeking 'authentic' Asian staples; it's all changed to some degree to suit American taste buds... nothing wrong with that, imo. Do I even know what 'authentic' Chinese food is? Yes, sortuv, somewhat. Will I stop putting quotes around 'everything'? Definitely not!\\\\n\\\\nIt was 45 min from closing time when we (party of 6) rushed in on a weeknight; got seated, ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff.\\\\n\\\\nThis particular PF Changs, on the Homestead Waterfront, had fast and friendly service, though he forgot our order of asparagus. We sampled everything from the the Szechuan shrimp to the Mongolian beef to the Dan Dan Noodles. Good flavors, nothing that stepped out in the crowd.\\\\n\\\\nI don't come here all that often but when I do, I invariably leave feeling satisfied and full.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"12_chinese_food_the\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"12_chinese_food_the\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[13.098371505737305,13.352535247802734,13.2975435256958,13.297947883605957,13.248491287231445,13.112646102905273,13.033568382263184,13.157626152038574,13.281950950622559,13.25047492980957,13.18343734741211,12.877795219421387,13.158019065856934,13.044190406799316,13.114364624023438,13.165082931518555,13.256258964538574,13.199369430541992,13.235387802124023,13.253681182861328,13.203252792358398,13.346320152282715,13.214022636413574,13.198535919189453,13.10788345336914,13.357248306274414,12.90300178527832,13.256816864013672,13.22746467590332,13.187355041503906],\"y\":[9.548934936523438,9.734814643859863,9.660703659057617,9.71823501586914,9.63489055633545,9.581489562988281,9.697587013244629,9.624959945678711,9.741000175476074,9.66956901550293,9.522989273071289,9.303689956665039,9.621148109436035,9.531344413757324,9.550742149353027,9.60481071472168,9.674834251403809,9.607894897460938,9.71528434753418,9.627277374267578,9.659321784973145,9.752551078796387,9.624914169311523,9.671198844909668,9.845170974731445,9.779996871948242,9.331384658813477,9.692774772644043,9.657615661621094,9.634039878845215],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"One comfy seat in the entire place, but they have a cafe, they have good books to look at, and they are open until 11pm.

I am such a nerd...only a nerd would enjoy going to a book store and reading as much as I do.  The extra amenities just make it that much more enjoyable.\",\"This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \\\\n\\\\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \\\\n\\\\nThey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \\\\\\\"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\\\\\\\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \\\\n\\\\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \\\\\\\"main drag\\\\\\\" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.\",\"The coffee here was excellent! Had a double espresso. Apparently their roaster is in Santa Cruz Ca. Large selection of French Press Coffees. Baked goods did not look too great but that is not why I came here. Atmosphere is very mellow and comfortable. Also has Wifi which works! Nice to find a place like this when traveling. Is in the middle of a residential area and there doesnt seem to be anything else around here.\",\"The coffee was ok, but the service and ambiance left much to be desired. The place was dirty, with straw wrappers etc on the floor. The light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy. There were four people on staff but it took at least 2 minutes for one of them to stop gossiping with the others and take our order.  I got the feeling that this place has had a lot of success and the owners have let things slide. It was ok, but in looking for a coffee shop to make my regular hangout, I would not go back.\",\"Great variety of coffee and methods (press, Chemex, pour-over).  I did not get a chance to try to the espresso, but it looked very good as well. Verve and Olympia are two very solid roasters and provide a wealth of choices. \\\\n\\\\nStaff was very helpful, location great. All around a good place in Pittsburgh.\",\"I live close by so I go here frequently pretty much for the free WIFI and espresso. But here's a secret - they don't seem to know what an Americano is so often I am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request. Needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled. Although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste. Pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful. There is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta. Outside seating and people watching is always a good distraction plus there are all kinds of people who frequent this Panera from the very very old and decrepit to the fashionistas taking a break from Victoria Secrets, Ulta, Wet Seal and the other various shops at this water front location.\",\"I think the lattes have improved since my last review and their soy cappuccinos are the best I've ever had, in fact, I never even cared for them until trying Tazza D'oro's. I still hold their teas in high regard. However, the food here sucks. They've always had a limited sandwich menu, but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices. I am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich, especially in combination with caffeine. Even though Enrico's is an easy walk from my home, I find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. I guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews, but I don't think it's that hard to do both; I mean the staff seems highly competent, they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn. With a new lunch joint in the 'hood (Park Bruges), why not expand lunch options rather than downgrade to the point of forfeiting without even the slightest struggle?\",\"Maybe Tazza D'Oro doesn't need another review, but I guess it never hurts to lend your voice to the chorus of those praising a good, solid and well-run local business.  \\\\n\\\\nThe coffee selection is terrific.  The baristas are professional and courteous.  No, they are not chatty, but they are polite and friendly.  I'm not there for conversation, but for good coffee.  And that's what you get.  \\\\n\\\\nThe pastries and snacks are fine.  Good variety.  \\\\n\\\\nThe atmosphere is JUST what I want when I need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet, comfortable and calming.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen it first opened (how long ago how?) it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (I live in Highland Park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at \\\\\\\"others\\\\\\\" who stopped by.   They've either relaxed or found other obsessions.  The clientele is, as folks said, eclectic and invigorating.  \\\\n\\\\nIt's become our after-dinner spot after a meal at Park Bruges or Smiling Banana Leaf, too!\",\"This is where I learned what good espresso tastes like. If you make it to Highland Park, stop there and get some great neighborhood atmosphere.\",\"I love tazza.. Their coffees are excellent and its a great place to enjoy a relaxing evening..I also like their Baklawa, sandwiches and Brownies..\",\"Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy.\",\"Reasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. LOCATION and setting: Highland Park is simply lovely - makes you feel as if you are in a small English town, where time has stood still. The art and small tables inside and outside are charming.\\\\n2. Socially Responsible:Fair trade and international array of coffee.\\\\n3. Fresh Meat:  Local pasture raised meat/ local produce in their tasty panini's.\\\\n4. Nice crowd and staff.\",\"I adore this place! The light green walls are serene, the chairs and tables are comfortable, and I love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! The coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (I'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) If a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, I'll be a fan for life. The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California. I count Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle Coffee as some of my favorite places, so I mean it when I say the coffee here is wonderful. Try it out, you won't be let down.\",\"I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area.\",\"As far as Starbucks go, this is a pretty nice one.  The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\",\"This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!\\\\n\\\\nSeating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.\\\\n\\\\nBaristas are friendly and fast.\",\"Mmm...peppermint mocha\\\\n\\\\nIn my quest to visit every Starbucks in the USA I have stopped at yet another location.  This one is located in the center of a circle road -- very cache and in a newer part of the area.\",\"The coffee here is amazing (I love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). The baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. While there are a number of tables, Enrico's was busy even on a Friday night...I would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours.\",\"Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.\\\\n\\\\nThe coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.\\\\n\\\\nAll that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.\",\"I just realized they remodeled this one recently-ish. Well, in my world recently because it's been a while since I've been here.\\\\n\\\\nThey've added more seating which makes it way more conducive to having a meeting here. Which is my concern during the week. I imagine during the weekend it just fills up with tweens getting their sugar rush before hitting the movie theater. \\\\n\\\\nThe coffee, or tea for me.. Is still same old same old. I don't imagine one single Starbucks will break the mold and make original drinks...\",\"Still one of the best places to get soy capps, but they no longer have an extensive tea list. What's left is not a bad selection, but there are dramatically less choices, so it's no longer where I would go to sample new varieties of tea. Sandwich menu is even more severely limited and it seems that pretty much all the food is provided by U.S. Foods, or the like; nothing is local. It'd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally. Until then, it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso, with nice vibes and pleasant service.\",\"We ordered a double espresso which looked more like a single shot. Cozy coffeeshop with an ample amount of seating.\\\\n\\\\nThere were different types of coffee available for purchase to drink there and beans to take home.\\\\n\\\\nCute neighborhood coffeeshop type feel.\",\"This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea, coffee, snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. I used to frequent this place much more when I lived in Pittsburgh, but I still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. It is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  The staff is great and the prices are reasonable, too. The only change I could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. It'd make the vibe a little more comfortable!\",\"I've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and I'm sorry, but I don't wholly agree with, well, everyone else; so, here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe.  I'm aware, like many reviewers on this site, that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still, there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.  But the place itself was a turn off, despite the interesting people that it attracts.  Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.  I think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park, but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive.\",\"Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful\",\"It's good when they are on, but they are so inconsistent you never know what you are going to get.  The coffee machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in the last century which is off putting.  Generally, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are in the neighborhood and desperately hungry--you MIGHT catch a lucky break and be there on a good day.\",\"If there was ever a \\\\\\\"get your coffee and go\\\\\\\" Starbucks, this is it. Right in the center of the Waterfront, this Starbucks has no sofa, comfy chairs, only table seating. I love the baristas here, But I don't like the location of the building.\",\"This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them.\",\"I'll preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that 3 stars is a good review for me--it means it's good, but I'm not going to go out of my way for it.  \\\\n\\\\nEnrico's Tazza D'oro Cafe is definitely very good--I love the location in Highland Park, and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic.  We even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat.  \\\\n\\\\nMy girlfriend and I ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin I would say the ones they had looked good.  I do wish they had more outdoor seating, though.  It's tough to make the \\\\\\\"I'm a fan\\\\\\\" list for coffee houses.  I'll try it again and may change my review in the future.  \\\\n\\\\nWhile I\\\\\\\"m on the note of Highland Park, I want to join the chorus of people who are dismayed by the recent hit and run involving the two bikers in Highland Park.  Accidents (no matter how horrible) do happen, and as such I'm not as angry about the actual accident;  but to just drive away and leave people severely injured by the side of the road is pretty wretched behavior.  At this point, i only hope that if you are the person who did this, you will at least dedicate the rest of your life to doing good to balance your to-date lousy behavior.\\\\n\\\\nIt's never too late.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"13_coffee_the_is\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"13_coffee_the_is\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[9.855249404907227,10.28698444366455,10.337934494018555,9.941084861755371,10.547643661499023,10.288445472717285,10.337884902954102,10.1968412399292,10.200186729431152,10.265837669372559,10.372364044189453,10.157502174377441,10.60600757598877,9.85921573638916,9.889970779418945,9.87162971496582,10.034616470336914,9.917825698852539,10.310976028442383,9.90572738647461,10.362876892089844,10.16408920288086,9.868160247802734,10.132681846618652,7.306995391845703,9.985185623168945,9.891020774841309,9.823205947875977,10.21839714050293,10.032294273376465],\"y\":[4.588567733764648,4.3296637535095215,4.379265785217285,4.426441192626953,4.6176581382751465,4.345885753631592,4.268436431884766,4.296387672424316,4.37221622467041,4.311056613922119,4.400277137756348,4.44306755065918,4.7197065353393555,4.561488628387451,4.480970859527588,4.459251880645752,4.412083148956299,4.474277496337891,4.292807579040527,4.479800701141357,4.321593761444092,4.407207489013672,4.785067081451416,4.368700981140137,6.326216697692871,4.398115158081055,4.475409507751465,4.511773109436035,4.313434600830078,4.502304553985596],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all.

Let me get the bar part out of the way first, it's overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. \\\\n\\\\nNext, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. \\\\n\\\\nThe games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.\\\\n\\\\nOverall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century.\",\"This place just plain sucks\\\\nBad management lost them biz\\\\nDumb arcade drama*\\\\n\\\\n* they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old\",\"ehh, 3.5 -- I can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. \\\\n\\\\nI'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\\\\n\\\\nThe food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)\\\\n\\\\nDrinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \\\\n\\\\nThe prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \\\\\\\"cost\\\\\\\" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.\\\\n\\\\nOverall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. \\\\n\\\\nI can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.\",\"Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff.\",\"When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\\\\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\\\\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\\\\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\\\\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \\\\nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \\\\nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \\\\nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.\",\"This club is now officially closed for good due to redevelopment in the area.\",\"DAVE & BUSTERS!  It's a nice place to eat, have fun and drink!!  All ages can enjoy this place.  I was so EXCITED to hear them announce that after 10p, all children whether accompanied by a guardian or not had to go!  It made for a nice evening for adults only.  \\\\n\\\\nEverytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves.  I didn't give it FOUR STARS because every time I've went I haven't been able to eat in the restaurant area of there.  I know I still get the same food that everyone else does wherever you sit.  Sometimes, I like the nice relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant.  I haven't as of yet, been seated there.  \\\\n\\\\nNot to mention that the servers around the bar, are a little slow at responding to customers as well.  So all in all, D&B's is a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment.  Just don't expect to be seated in the restaurant portion, and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area.\",\"Sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos.  On the one hand, there are plenty of waterslides/pools that are a good fit for young \\\\\\\"riders\\\\\\\", on the other hand, Sandcastle, like any city amusement park, attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood.  \\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately that element doesn't particularly care about \\\\\\\"censoring\\\\\\\" speech for 9 year old ears, and worse, in the Mon Tsunami, about personal space, since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and 'showing off' for the fairer sex, and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.\\\\n\\\\nHaving said that, it's still a good day at the park. . . cheese fries, a cool dip in the pool on a hot day, some fun slides. . . \\\\n\\\\nI think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park.  It is NOT policed particularly effectively.  if you take small children you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings, paying attention to the group of 17 somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity, \\\\\\\"accidentally\\\\\\\" bumping into people for a reaction from their group.  \\\\n\\\\nMOSTLY it's a good time.  Mostly.\",\"I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \\\\\\\"games\\\\\\\", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.\",\"went in as a guest of a friend of mine who is a member there... nice atmosphere.

They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.\\\\n\\\\nYou pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).\\\\n\\\\nWaitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.\\\\n\\\\nThe games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.\\\\n\\\\nNot a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant.\",\"My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together.

What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \\\\\\\"donate\\\\\\\" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes!

The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. The foot bath was nice and warm. I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.\\\\n\\\\nNancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.\\\\n\\\\nThis is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.\\\\nEND TMI\\\\n\\\\nEven though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. Polish on and all done! At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.\\\\n\\\\nThe manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.\\\\n\\\\nThe polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.\\\\n\\\\nAgain, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.\\\\n\\\\nThey also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art. I'm not sure if they do waxing. I am sure that it's a friendly place, that it's clean (important!), and that they made me feel relaxed even though I was beyond nervous going in.\",\"Got my hair done in an updo (for only $25!!!!)  yesterday for my wedding.  they did amazing!  they listened to what i wanted and although it took quite a while (i have really long hair) she spent the time to do it right and exactly how i wanted it.  great service!!

I may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate, but this place gives me the creeps, sounds dirty, and has beyond bad customer service.  They definitely do NOT know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well.

I have been going there for about 4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet. ( you curly girls know what I am talking about). I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed. The only complaint I ever have is that yes, sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week.

First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be \\\\\\\"difficult\\\\\\\" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to \\\\\\\"Locks of Love,\\\\\\\" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.\\\\n\\\\nI watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it \\\\\\\"wasn't looking right.\\\\\\\"  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.\\\\n\\\\nAt that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, \\\\\\\"I have to leave, so sorry \\\\\\\"as I bolted for the door.\",\"Nothing spectacular, but I go there regularly, and generally get a cut that works fine for at least a couple of months.  They did a good job after I had a botched cut overseas (hairdressers in Japan are, understandably, not necessarily qualified to work on non-Asian hair, as they don't cut a lot of it). Parking can be tough, depending on time of day--there's a shared private lot, but it's small.\",\"They made my Portuguese Water Dog look horrible. \\\\n\\\\nThey actually sheared all the fur from my dog claiming that it was matted and therefore they had no choice. This isn't true as I personally brush my dog every morning. When I complained, the owner said: \\\\\\\"But we did tell you that we will cut the dog's fur short.\\\\\\\"  Yes, they did, and I thought that considering that the days are hot in August, they are proposing a little cooler grooming. I never expected them to just shear the dog to the skin. \\\\nI think they did it because they are hopelessly irresponsible. Although they charged $70 for this brutally simple operation they have not even trimmed dog's ears and tail. Consequently, the dog has disproportionally long hair on its tail and the ears. \\\\nI used Animal Elegance for more than a decade. Long before current management took over.

It's been a long time since I've been to a barber shop or haircut salon/store, but from what I remember this place seems completely average. The hair stylists seem nice enough and competent. The wait was a few minutes- I actually expected the wait to be longer because we came in on a Saturday.

My dog  was not groomed to my specifications; infact she was butchered. I went to the trouble of taking a photo of my dog with  the haircut that I wanted, as well as speaking with the woman who assured me she would be grooming my dog. The owner groomed my dog, not the woman that I spoke with and she looked nothing like my dog when I picked her up. The owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service.

I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time.\",\"Figure I'd give Supercuts a shot since Giant Eagle sells their gift cards so it is great for fuelperks.

My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \\\\\\\"dentist\\\\\\\" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \\\\\\\"you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\\\\\\\". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \\\\\\\"bone graft\\\\\\\". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \\\\\\\"dentist\\\\\\\" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers.\",\"Top notch doctor in a top notch practice.

The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. \\\\n- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: \\\\\\\"Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped.\\\\\\\" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly \\\\\\\"If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them.\\\\\\\" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. \\\\n- The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. \\\\n- The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while. \\\\n- The fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here.\",\"I'm a gym guy.

It is a review on their customer/membership service. I just called there. All I wanted to know is what their monthly fees were. Simple right? Wrong. They want your name and phone number and the rights to your first born child and then they won't even tell you anything without you physically coming to them to \\\\\\\"talk\\\\\\\" about what's best for you. I took psychology classes, I know what they are trying to do by talking to you face to face. I am sorry, but I want a gym, not a drug dealer. I don't need you to try to shove your products down my throat, I want to go somewhere to work out and be left alone. (That's why I wear headphones and don't make eye contact). \\\\n\\\\nI just wish places like this would give you a straight answer about their membership fees without hassling you. I won't go here now, period, because I don't believe in these kind of tactics. Just be straight with people, is that so hard?\",\"I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!\",\"I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.  They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs.\\\\n\\\\nDreams crushed.  Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room.  I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.\\\\n\\\\nSo we bouldered.  The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another.  You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss.  With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.\\\\n\\\\nThe place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.  I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's).\\\\n\\\\nSide note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area.  Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully.\\\\n\\\\nI expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh.\",\"Very primitive bouldering area, but the routes were challenging, in part due to the lack of a smearable surface (plywood kinda painted to look like rocks),  mega shitty footholds (jibs worn down to shiny scummy nubs that sorely needed cleaning or replacing), and a distinct lack of fall-friendliness (one old mat to be shared among every 3 or 4 walls, and an unforgiving floor that thudded every time someone landed on it).  Not a bargain for a $12 day pass since the routes did not seem to have been changed very often and all climbs shared the same foot jibs which looked practically permanent. The changing room was literally a closet.\\\\n\\\\nAll that griping aside, there were some decent climbs. The V3's were fairly easy but the V3/V4's were exponentially harder. I was able to do one V4/V5, but my butt was royally kicked on everything else. No ego boosts here, and the masochist in me awards 3 stars to this old school climbing gym.\",\"There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was quite disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects.  \\\\n\\\\nFirst of all, the gym in pretty cheap.  And the bouldering area is really quite good.  To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area.  Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. \\\\n\\\\nIt seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent.  I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon.  The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow the downsides.  The staff wasn't very helpful.  The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test.  It's poor form. \\\\n\\\\nThe ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull.  They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground.  I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. \\\\n\\\\nThe walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible.  Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned.  Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous.  \\\\n\\\\nThere's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean.  I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity.\",\"I've been climbing for a few years but have friends who have never climbed. This place has lots of climbs at all different levels so my friends and I can enjoy climbing here together.  Plus they have instructional classes if you want to learn more. It has a great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends or meet new people. The staff are amazing! Very nice and very helpful. The prices are very reasonable, lower than any other gym I have climbed in (and I have climbed in lots of facilities). I definitely recommend climbing here.\",\"I'm giving this the ok rating, I am not an experienced climber but a beginner. The last climb I went out was a real one in Utah with my brother who got me all harnessed up only to instruct me to place my foot and hand level with my head and pull myself up . You can imagine how that went with my golden retriever feverish barking and running below instructing my brother to let me down lol.\\\\n\\\\nSo for a beginner I found the price to be ok I went with a group and paid 16$ for shoe rental and I guess climbing fee? We stayed for about two hours. We went on a Saturday it was very crowded probably 15-30 people in the place but there are so many choices you can still get a wall. There were several beginner climbs that are easy for anyone with a shred of upper body strength. Then some V2 and V3 and V4, the other beginner gals I was climbing with found there was a pretty big variation from the VB to V2 on some of the climbs. So sometimes it was better just not to follow the stickers completely if you're a beginner but still looking for variation while bouldering. \\\\n\\\\nI think safety-wise things are bit of a liability here, walls are high, mats are very old and very few. Also lots of people don't follow the basic rules including teenagers who are there alone. So be cautious of your space an d others space and consider fatigue when getting to the top of those walls with your hands all sweaty. \\\\n\\\\nI also expected it to be a little larger based on the website photos, but I understand that this is Pittsburgh not a city with room for a huge gym like out west. I also think if they were to build a bigger newer gym here with higher climbs, then you would be looking at paying $25 and up. \\\\n\\\\nMy biggest complaint is that you can only do lessons at certain times with a harness, this makes it harder for beginners to get in and get a feel. I did complete one or two V7 or V8. Just to push myself but I would have had more fun if I had the support of a rope so the next time I go back I will consider classes. Which costs a little bit more but oh well. Class times are limited check the website.\",\"Pittsburgh doesn't really have its choice of indoor climbing walls, but I was pretty impressed by this location (though note, this review is just for bouldering). The bouldering area is huge, and on a Saturday afternoon surprisingly empty with no need to wait for any route. It's labeled from V0 upwards... although the floor is padded, the walls do go up pretty high (the 10ft estimate from before is accurate), so a fall would be pretty scary... they do give you an option to wear a helmet, but I saw nobody doing so.\\\\n\\\\nThe routes are all clearly marked, and difficulty seemed to correspond with rating - there are also a ton to choose from, so you won't get bored. One staff member in particular was amazing - Allen - who spent the time giving climbing tips and encouragement to whomever needed it. Costs are also reasonable ($12/day, + $3/shoes, $2/chalk), and it's located in a nice strip mall with the East End Co-Op nearby for food. Overall, not a bad place to spend an afternoon!\",\"The blonde woman who tuns the gym was extremely rude to us. First time we went she refused yo.get off the phone on a personal call to help us. Then she gave us the rules for the bouldering area in a rapid bored monotone. Compared to other climbing gyms I have gone to this gym is less safe (no gri-gris), unfriendly, and more expensive. Definitely not worth it. Worst customer service I've seen in a while.\",\"Some helpful hints for the Climbing Wall:\\\\n\\\\n-A one-day pass is $12.  College students/active military pay $10.  Wednesday is 1/2 price for ladies (but only after they pay full price on the first visit).  Wednesday is also 1/2 price for guys who wear a sports bra.  Yup, you heard me right.  Wednesdays are usually pretty crowded.\\\\n\\\\n-They run a different membership special every month.  If you climb more than once a week, a membership can definitely be worth it.\\\\n\\\\n-If it's your first time at the wall, I highly suggest just doing the \\\\\\\"bouldering certification\\\\\\\" instead of the \\\\\\\"safety and belay certification class.\\\\\\\"  The bouldering certification takes about 5 minutes and then you can start climbing.  Decide if you like it, then do the belay certification.\\\\n\\\\n-If you \\\\\\\"like\\\\\\\" them on facebook, you can get updates about when they change the routes, what membership specials they're running, if they're selling any old/used shoes for discounted prices, etc.  \\\\n\\\\nThe wall is in a great location, on several bus routes, and right next to the East End Food Co-op.  It can get crowded, but everyone takes turns so you have plenty of opportunities.\",\"If you like being greeted in the morning by a gym worker slopping down eggs from a frying pany instead of working....this is your gym....complain to the manager and she gets nasty....try getting in touch with the owner....impossible!  Most unprofessional gym ever!!!!\",\"I bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes. I was in my early sixties and hadn't exercised in a while. I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. Do they think that this is their private gym?\",\"As a new climber I found the whole process intimidating, but the staff at The Climbing Wall helped me get on the right path. Also, the regulars here seemed very nice and always willing to help out a newbie. It isn't very expensive either, 10 or 12 bucks for a full day of bouldering is a very reasonable deal (I haven't seen many places which were cheaper). \\\\n\\\\nI'm sure a lot of people, including myself, wish this place was a little bigger, but for being in the city it's not a bad size. It's actually surprising how many routes they managed to plan out for the size of the place, there's more than enough to keep the walls feeling fresh even after many climbs. The diversity of the routes is really great too, there's plenty of routes for each skill level and climbing style. \\\\n\\\\nThe overall experience was wonderful: great staff, great people, and a great setup. \\\\n\\\\nTip: If you're a beginner without your own equipment, the shoe rental is worth the extra 3 or 4 bucks.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"17_climbing_gym_walls\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"17_climbing_gym_walls\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[6.466643810272217,6.388866424560547,6.401878833770752,6.3858489990234375,6.468254089355469,6.47208833694458,6.4231486320495605,6.43522310256958,6.459300518035889,6.485861301422119,6.390089511871338,6.464549541473389,6.396955966949463,6.376302242279053,6.443291187286377,6.430553913116455],\"y\":[2.99902081489563,3.0699570178985596,3.072006940841675,3.0818305015563965,2.9916062355041504,2.9923858642578125,3.0187723636627197,3.008005380630493,2.9782967567443848,2.9552595615386963,3.058173894882202,2.963103771209717,3.0491249561309814,3.0809733867645264,2.9820220470428467,3.020035982131958],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"This is a terrible shelter.

My previous vet in NY was just wonderful and I was doubtful that I would find another as good or as caring as her. Over the past 3 years I have taken my cat there not only for his yearly's but for other heatlth issues and was alway met with caring staff. Dr. Simard is my favorite vet there, and I try to get her as often as I can, but I have also seen Dr. Berger who is great and have heard good things about Dr. Schroth as well. Dr. Gerson is the owner, I have seen him once and he is a tad gruff, but if you are direct with him he is easy to work with. \\\\nMy cat has always had a bit of a weight issue and since going to Point Breeze and working with Dr. Simard my cat has gone from 25 lbs to 18lbs and we seem to be well on the way to Dr. Simards goal of 16lbs. \\\\nMy cat was also treated by Dr. Simard for a bad case of worms, after apparently catching and consuming a mouse in our basement - again they got me in right away and before I knew it he was worm-free. \\\\nI have never felt like they wanted to up-sell me on anything, and they have always been very patient and willing to hear my concerns. \\\\nI really love this clinic, and truely believe that they exceed in animal care.\",\"Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\\\\n\\\\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\\\\n\\\\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\\\\n\\\\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. \\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?\\\\n\\\\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\\\\n\\\\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. \\\\n\\\\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\\\\n\\\\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter!\",\"I took my cat here for a preliminary checkup after adopting her from the animal shelter & then again to have her declawed. I was very impressed by the facilities and service. The facilities are spotless & modern, and the vets seem both knowledgeable and willing to spend time with you and your animal.\\\\n\\\\nI was particularly impressed when I had my cat declawed. They kept her for several days to monitor my progress & called me each day to update me on her progress.\\\\n\\\\nIt seems a bit expensive (although I have no other point of comparison) but the service is well worth it.\",\"I have an almost three-year-old cat named Jack that I spoil as if he were my son.

Check this location out!\",\"That is a great cat they have working, but they only have 3 brands of cat food, all of them expensive.  Funny enough though not as expensive as what I was looking for.  They followed me around like I was going to stuff my pockets and that just ruined the whole mom and pop thing.\",\"I'm a crazy cat lady and proud of it! \\\\n\\\\nBeing a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels.  It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. \\\\n\\\\nNow I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for \\\\\\\"cat cuddling.\\\\\\\"  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. \\\\n\\\\nThe other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. \\\\n\\\\nI would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!  \\\\n\\\\nJust check it out if you're curious.  You won't regret it!  Your new furry friends will appreciate it as well!\",\"The vet met with us for a very short amount of time. She was rushed, seemed distracted, and was abrupt. She very quickly said that it seemed like SCC, or oral cancer, and that there was no cure and the prognosis wasn't good.

After she said she thought it was SCC, she didn't give us a chance to ask questions or respond. \\\\n\\\\nThe technician didn't have any demeanor with our cat, nor with us as clients. She seemed tired, and overworked.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, this was a negative experience. I recommend that you take your pets to another vet :(\",\"Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address.

During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me.  Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.  A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter).  I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.  The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing.  In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.  Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.\\\\n\\\\nI would highy suggest adopting from this shelter.  I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok.  The shetler staff care deeply about the animal AND the human's well-being!\",\"The problem I have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted 3 minutes.

Delicious.  A strange snickerdoodle thing with pink frosting.  Delicious. Chocolate chip cookie dipped in chocolate, extra chewy and humongous.  Delicious.\\\\n\\\\nAnd a sweet old lady serving em up.\\\\n\\\\nThe best.\\\\n\\\\nDelicious.\",\"Came across this place after checking out a Thai restaurant across the street. The name intrigued my family and I, and it looked like adorable from the outside. \\\\n\\\\nI fell in love instantly. And came back several times after first discovering this hidden gem. You walk in and the wonderful smells just overwhelm you in just an amazing way. The ambiance is that of an old style kitchen- personally, it reminds me of one of my aunts kitchens, which gives it that homey feel that is so comforting. They have seating- which I never saw in any bakeries prior to this one. They also serve coffee and encourage you to take a seat and enjoy your sweet treat. \\\\n\\\\nThey offer such a unique array of sweets. Definitely not your typical bakery. Pies, tortes, mooses and cookies.. And when they do have cinnamon rolls, grab them! They are a hot commodity! My personal favorite is their key lime pie. Oh my goodness. It's amazing. They have had it every time that I came, thank goodness. Their key lime cake is phenomenal as well. Their fruit tarts are incredible, the chocolate moose is amazing- they have a lot of items with fresh fruit which I love! \\\\n\\\\nMy only critiques- the hours: they are closed on Mondays and Sundays :/, not ideal for someone whose only day off is typically Sunday. And also, they write all the items thy have in the case on a small chalkboard posted on the wall to the right of the case. Every time I go, I find myself asking the employees what everything is, which I find to be a little annoying. Regardless- it's worth it. It's such a hidden gem and going there and experiencing their sweets is a real treat.\",\"Lincoln Bakery is yet another local bakery I've been meaning to try.  When a Google Offer came up, I took it so I would have no excuse to keep avoiding it.  The place has a nice neighborhood bakery feel; as I took in the many selections it seemed that everyone who came in was a regular.  There weren't many people when I was there (it was still relatively early) but I got the impression that at times there can be a line to the door.  \\\\nOne thing that I didn't like was although they had many pastries to choose from, nothing was labeled.  So I had to keep asking what things were.  The cinnamon roll was okay, nothing spectacular.  But the pastries I got were very good.  I'd recommend checking it out.  I know if I'm ever in the neighborhood I will stop in for a treat myself.\",\"This place has probably some of the best pastries I've ever encountered.  The treats are consistently great to amazing to even mouth watering.  The bakery is this quaint little place that is really cute with nice baking decorations and everything.  The staff is really friendly and always helpful with making the hard selection.  The cupcakes are these cream-stuffed pieces of heaven, and their signature sandwiches are out of this world.  Everything else leaves nothing to be desired, and keeps me coming back as frequently as I can find someone to accompany me.\",\"Cookies aren't bad.  Haven't had a reason to buy cakes or other pastries.  Staff is friendly and it smells like heaven.\",\"I arrived on a Thursday afternoon at 5pm when there was absolutely no other soul in the bakery (except for the staff). My pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright. I also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake. The key lime cake was definitely the best of the three.\\\\n\\\\nWhile I've been to better bakeries, I will definitely be back. I have heard stories of wonder and delight from other friends.\\\\n\\\\nThere is a small seating area with tables and a water dispenser for diners.\",\"Got a key lime pie from this place. It was horrid. Icing was stale cake thick, crust was not even crunchy or had taste, and the key lime was weak. Pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or 2.\",\"Quite possibly the best bakery in Pittsburgh.  It's got everything from the low-end (cookies, cupcakes, donuts) to the high (wedding cakes, tortes, tarts).  Make any special or large orders weeks in advance.  The tastiest wedding cake I ever sampled was from here: smooth buttercream icing with alternating raspberry and lemon filling in white batter.\",\"My sister, husband, and I went in after early dinner. It was completely unplanned but we were attracted to the quaint storefront. We purchased a crispy elephant ear-like dessert sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. It was glorious. I bought a piece of apple-walnut-cinnamon sugar cake with cream cheese frosting. It was delicious an moist. We also purchased freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. They were absolutely rich and scrumptious. The woman who was there an greeted us seemed like she might be the owner. She was sweet and very helpful. Great disposition. This is probably my favorite small bakery in Pittsburgh. Delightful.\",\"Lincoln Bakery makes very delicious donuts, pastries, and desserts. Their bread selection, however, was very limited and upon making our choice the quality of the bread was mediocre. We were also disappointed that many of the things in the shop are not labeled and when the store is busy it can be difficult to find staff to explain what different options are. Still, this should be a go to for a local bakery if you are looking for something sweet.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"22_bakery_lime_key\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"22_bakery_lime_key\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[13.336647987365723,13.385765075683594,13.369501113891602,13.39233112335205,13.407482147216797,13.399245262145996,13.366035461425781,13.313867568969727,13.387085914611816,13.372498512268066,13.394104957580566,13.374960899353027],\"y\":[8.411568641662598,8.423958778381348,8.423979759216309,8.421953201293945,8.43946647644043,8.419271469116211,8.405749320983887,8.458081245422363,8.379711151123047,8.41807746887207,8.423559188842773,8.420488357543945],\"type\":\"scattergl\"}],

    "A major advance in NLP over the last 10 years has been [word embedding models](https://ruder.io/word-embeddings-1/). These provide a way to quantify word meaning. Embeddings are typically \"pre-trained\" by learning the context of words that tend to co-occur. A classic example is [word2vec](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/). One example is [Tensorboard Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`whatlies`](https://github.com/koaning/whatlies) package tries to help you to understand: \"What lies in word embeddings?\". It is created by [Vincent Warmerdam](https://koaning.io/whois/) and colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This small library offers tools to make visualisation easier of both word embeddings as well as operations on them. This should be considered an experimental project. This library will allow you to make visualisations of transformations of word embeddings. Some of these transformations are linear algebra operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library uses [`altair`](https://altair-viz.github.io/), which is a Python package for [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). "
